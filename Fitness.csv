**INTRO/BACKGROUND**

* I first ran Super Squats when I was in college, well over 15 years ago…and never ran it again since.  In my mind it was one of the most effective programs of all time AND once of the most traumatic experiences of all time.  I could still remember the pain of those 20 rep sets, the anxiety that existed between workouts, and being SO happy when it was over.  I said I’d run it again some day, and had recommended the book to SO many trainees, yet took SO long to finally saddle back up and do it all over again.

* A lot had changed between then and now.  One of the biggest factors being that I had my ACL reconstructed in 2015 after rupturing it and part of my meniscus in a strongman competition.  That changes squats a little.  But I was also much smarter about training and nutrition than I was as a meathead college kid, so that’s cool.

* For the full rundown on stats, I’m 37, 5’9, bodyweight somewhere in the high 180s, have lifted weights for 23 years, competed in strongman for a decade off and on, did some powerlifting, combat sports/martial arts experience, and has accumulated some bumps and scrapes along the way.    

**WHAT SUPER SQUATS IS/IS NOT**

* First, it is NOT a squatting program.  Oh my god I hate how I have to keep explaining this.  Am I the ONLY one who got taught “Don’t judge a book by its cover?”  Same thing with the “30lbs of muscle in 6 weeks” thing: quit focusing on that.  The squatting in Super Squats is PURELY a mechanism employed to trigger muscular bodyweight growth in a trainee.  It wasn’t a program designed with “improving your squat as much as possible!” or “the surefire solution to chicken legs!”: the BREATHING squat is chosen because it’s a way to trigger full body growth.  And no: I don’t mean “it causes the release of HGH/testosterone”: I’m talking about the fact that, when you do breathing squats, you spend a LOT of time with a weight on your back, which is signaling to your body that the whole BODY needs a LOT more muscle SOON if it wants to survive.  The squatting itself adds stimulus, absolutely, but I’ve found that one can employ good mornings to a similar effect, and there’s a solid argument about being able to employ trap bar lifts as well.

* It is a SYSTEM, not a workout.  Specifically, that system is premised upon the idea of putting the entire body under SIGNIFICANT stress 2-3 times a week, and consistently upping that stress so that it’s never able to fully cope.  This is why you use the weight you’d squat for 10 to do 20 reps, and it’s why you add 5lbs per workout.  A lot of folks seem to think the magic is just in the squat set, so they’ll do a set of 20 breathing squats ONE time and go “Yeah, that was hard, but I don’t see the big deal”.  The big deal is that you have to do it AGAIN 2 days later…with 5lbs more than before…for 6 weeks.  You can’t just take the squats part of Super Squats in isolation: it’s a whole system.  It’s also why the gallon of milk a day is associated with it: it’s a system of training insanely hard and then eating VERY big so that you can be recovered enough to achieve the next goal.  It’s why when people ask “what should I do if I fail” on the program, I tell them “don’t”.  If you are actually eating as much as you need to eat and following the program, success should be your only outcome…assuming you have the necessary mental fortitude to get through it.

* [It is a BOOK](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005).  Every time I see a trainee fail with “Super Squats”, it’s because they’re not actually doing Super Squats, because they didn’t read the book.  The book can be read in an afternoon and it’s $10 on Kindle: there’s zero excuse for not reading it.  It explains EVERYTHING.  It doesn’t just lay out a program: it walks you through step by step how to execute it, gives you instructions on how to perform ALL the exercises, it lays out a very effective nutrition protocol, it gives you psychological coaching to get through the squat set (along with saying MANY times that it’s 3 deep breaths between EVERY rep…but I digress), and even goes into the history of squatting and strong people in general, and EVEN gives you a follow-on plan so you can actually run Super Squats for QUITE a long duration.  There is a reason I practically THROW this book at every new trainee: if you read it, you will have pretty much everything you could ever need.

**MY RUN OF THE PROGRAM**

* When I began Super Squats, I was amazed at how many people who read my blog kept asking me what my plan was.  “You started at 315lbs: are you planning on going all the way to 405 for 20?”  “You’ve done 5x10x405: are you planning on going higher than 405?”  “Are you planning on making this even more challenging than the book says?”.  I kept saying the same thing: “My goal is to experience this experience”.  It was to the point that I think OTHER people were getting anxiety over my “lack of a plan”.

* Folks: CHAOS IS THE PLAN.  It’s not just a thing I say: it’s the truth.

* …and BOY was it the truth.  When I originally mapped out the 6 week block of Super Squats, I had a full 6 weeks on my schedule with uninterrupted time set out.  2 weeks before I started, my job threw a trip on my schedule from Mon through Thurs of my first week of the program.   Cool, time to call an audible.  I did the first workout on a Friday, my second workout the Monday I left for the trip, and the third workout on the Friday that I returned home.

* …except that, in between Monday and Friday, on that work trip, I came down with RSV.  On Tuesday night of that week, I did not sleep, because my fever was so high I had forgotten how to sleep.  I literally ate non-stop for 2 hours before that, because my kid had RSV before I left and they were taking FOREVER to heal because they wouldn’t eat, so I knew calories were the answer.  My appetite was shot, but that’s never slowed me down before, and, thankfully, my room was fully stocked with travel food, because I know how to travel.

* …and then I STILL did my 3rd workout on Friday, with RSV…and promptly proceeded to pull something in my innerquad/outer hamstring on my right leg on rep 15, because I forgot to factor in the significant impact of dehydration when you’ve been losing all your fluids to an awful ragged cough.  Which, if you want some real fun: try BREATHING squats with RSV.  Also: symptoms last for 2 weeks…so that’s cool.

* Whelp, Chaos it the Plan: “What Would Bruce Randall Do?”  He’d do some goddamn good mornings, and that was EXACTLY what I did.  I figured: if a dude that broke his leg in 7 places could use good mornings to build up to a 600lb squat, I could use them to get through Super Squats.  [Cue one of the hardest workouts of my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp0RHBNFwgo)


* I kept the weight EXACTLY the same as what I failed on with the squats, because I figured THAT was the most significant part of the program.  It’s why I picked good mornings as well: it’d keep the weight ON my back in the same spot as before with the same weight as before.  

* I genuinely think that workout was so hard it scared my body into healing, because I was able to return to squatting again for the next workout.  I was in pain, sure, and I had to take the squats slow, but I wasn’t missing any reps.

* And then, like an idiot, I forgot the lessons I had learned about hydration and keeping my legs warm and, without my morning Gatorade and sweats, went and TORE my hamstring…this time on rep 20!  Yup: that was workout 7.

* Back on the good mornings, but this time the hamstring was so borked I couldn’t get the weight that I needed to for progression.  I got hurt with 345, and 350 wasn’t stable, so I warmed up until I felt the hamstring start to buckle and went for [max rep GMs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tcuISpN63w)


* So now Chaos really IS the plan: 5lb progressions between workouts just ceased.  What is one to do?  Well, the middle of that good morning workout and my next squat workout, Thanksgiving happened, which meant I had to [pull 401 reps with 135lbs on a high handle trap bar in a single set]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWkSz-QEtSk)


* Because traditions damnit!

* Next Super Squats workout, all my hamstring would tolerate was 315lbs, so I went and took it for a ride and only managed 16 reps before I could feel it start to buckle and bulge.  So I got to yes by racking the bar, trying 1 more rep, hitting my pullovers, and then immediately getting pissed off, strip the bar to 245lbs and get my 20 reps in.  Mission absolutely accomplished. Please note my use of knee wraps to hold my hamstring in place/together, as that would be in effect for the remainder of the program.

* …and with THAT, the new way forward began.  We had finished workout 9, which was halfway through the program, and a new plan emerged: take 315 for as many reps as possible.  Which is TOTALLY in-line with something the book discussed about dudes going for 30 reps with breathing squats. Chaos is the plan, and we moved forward with that plan.

* …and comically enough, people STILL asked me what I was planning.  “Are you going to stick with 315 or eventually up the weight?”  This whole run of SS could NOT be any more an indication of “Chaos is the Plan”.  And I’M SO thankful that I embraced that from the start.  If I set out with a goal to squat 405 for 20, I’d just be miserable with how this whole experience turned out, and probably would have shut it all down at the halfway point when I “failed” to add 5lbs.  Instead, I got to experience the most challenging run of Super Squats perhaps EVER performed: afflicted with RSV for about half of it, through torn muscles, adding a rep each session and nearly blacking out from effort, with some Bruce Randall good mornings for good measure.  This is the Chaos edition of Super Squats, and it’s amazing.

* For those that want to watch the whole process, [here is the youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xRsOupFXRk&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdHGXZa4ER6fRyj-7FrJPuy)

**MY SPECIFIC TRAINING PLAN**

* The very first time I ran the program 15 years ago, I did an abbreviated approach, because that was all the rage then.  This time, I wanted to stay pretty close to what the book laid out.  I did no calf work, and my ab work was standing ab wheel, but for the most part I stuck with the program laid out in the book while employing the exercises listed.  

* I created two separate training days (A and B) and rotated between them every training day, 3x a week.  Do, for example: Week 1 would go A-B-A, week 2 B-A-B, repeat.  This got me a little bit of variety and allowed me to have some extra recovery between sessions of SLDL.  They broke down as such.

**DAY A**

> Axle clean and strict press 3x10/superset with 50 band pull aparts

> Weighted dips 3x12/superset with axle bent over rows 2x15

> Breathing squats 1x20/pull overs 1x20

> Axle Straight Legged Deadlifts 1x15

> Poundstone curls (1 rep more than previous workout each time)

**DAY B**

> Incline DB bench 3x12/superset with 2x15 weighted chins

> Behind the neck press 3x10/superset with 50 band pull aparts

> Breathing squats 1x20/pull overs 1x20

> Kroc rows 1xmax reps

> Axle shrugs against bands 1xmax reps

> Reverse hyper 1x50+ reps

* Once this portion of the workout was finished, I’d drink a protein shake (a PROTEIN shake you philistines: NOT a carb/fat shake.  It was egg whites mixed with a scoop of protein powder), and then finish up with 20 reps of standing ab wheel, 30 glute ham raises, 25 push downs, band curls on day B, and then some manner of 3-5 minutes of conditioning.  

* On top of this, daily, I’d do either 5 minutes of kettlebell armor building complexes w/24kg bells or the “TABEARTA” workout of Barbell bear complexes with 95lbs getting in 3 complexes per round.

* In between Super Squats workouts (to include the two day break on the weekends), I’d do conditioning workouts.  I initially was a little cute and creative, but pretty quickly I settled into a rut of something I referred to as “Armor Bearer”, [which looked like this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11wjg0LBbQw)


* An “Armor Bearer” is 5 minutes of Dan John’s kettlebell “Armor Building Complex” (2 cleans, 1 press, 3 front squats) followed immediately with TABEARTA (tabata protocol Bear complexes w/95lbs).  

* Just 1 round of these can absolutely nuke you if you really push it (for me, that’s getting around 25 ABCs and a full 8 rounds of 3 complexes with the bears), but for the Tuesday workout I’d typically do 3 rounds of these.  Weekends would be 1-3 rounds.  On Thursdays, I’d end up doing something slightly less aggressive, like a circuit of swings, thrusters and burpee chins or something similar.  Basically, I’d recover/recharge over the weekends, come out hard * * Mon through Wed, and need a slight dip down in intensity on Thurs to be able to absolutely smash Friday.

* On Tues and Thurs, I’d train fasted.  I feel like that’s better for nutrient partitioning post workout.  For the Super Squats workouts, I had half a low carb bagel with sunflower seed butter pre-workout for the first half of the program, switching to a slice of homemade sourdough toast with sunflower butter for the second half…because my wife took up making sourdough and it’s amazing.

* Oh yeah, one other thing: I was STILL training first thing in the morning for all of these workouts.  Typically around 0400.

* What’s worth appreciating is that I realize this violates Super Squats recommendation of resting as much as possible between the workouts, but it SHOULD be noted that this DOES represent a significant reduction in training volume for me.  Instead of 40-60 minute conditioning workouts, I was doing 10-30.  Instead of 10-20 minute conditioning workouts post lifting, it was 3-5.  I was sleeping more, and the volume within the lifting workouts itself was on the lower side.  This program will STILL beat you down, no matter who you are, and it DOES require throttling back to recover.

**NUTRITION**

* It would be WAY too tedious to document what I was eating, because I am a constant grazer as it is and this program just turned my appetite up to 11.  But I’ll say that was probably the biggest thing: I stopped restricting myself and just ate if I felt any hunger.  I still stuck with Deep Water/Mountain Dogg approved stuff for the vast majority of my nutrition, but was a bit more willing to eat “off menu” here and there.  I maintained a focus on food quality, and didn’t need to resort to “dirty” eating to get in my calories.  Between avocados, nuts and nut/sunflower seed butter, it’s pretty easy to jack up calories, and mixed in with a variety of animal based protein sources and some keto magic breads/tortillas, I was in a good way.  My dirtiest daily item was a protein bar/keto bar, which is also one of the first things I cut out of a diet when I’m no longer gaining.

* Biggest meals were always my post training breakfast and my pre-bed time meal.  Eating before bed remains one of the most effective strategies I know for gaining, and I love starting the day off with a win by smashing a VERY large and nutritious breakfast.

**RESULTS**

* As much as it upsets people, I don’t weigh myself, and I took no before/after photos.  

* But what WAS amazing was how I was just smashing lifts every time I trained on this program.  I imagine coming into it with a LOT of accumulated volume and finally taking the time to laser focus it into an abbreviated approach really paid off, especially when paired with a LOT of food.  I’m not an excel ninja, so I’m just going to spell out the progress I had.

* Axle clean and strict press went from 3x10x136 to 2x10x171 and 1x9x171 (so close!). Behind the neck press from 3x10x95 to 3x10x135, Weighted dips went from 3x12x55 to 3x12x100 and weighted chins from 2x15x7.5lbs to 2x15x20lbs(keeping in mind I gained bodyweight through the program), DB bench from 3x12x80s to 3x12x105s, Axle rows went from 2x15x193 to 2x15x228, Axle SLDLs went from 15x243 to 15x283 (doing them AFTER the squats is just awful), Kroc rows from 15x115 to 23x115

* And, of course: Breathing Squats from 20x315 to 30x315…WITH a recovering torn hamstring

**LEESSONS LEARNED**

* The squats themselves are immaterial: it’s more about the loading of the body and hard effort.  In turn, the “5lbs per week” is also immaterial.  Good mornings and increasing reps proved viable, and I’m sure there is much more room to play around with.  But that’s why we run these programs: we learned lessons like that that we can carry forward.

* If you’re not drinking the gallon of milk a day, you’ll have to eat like it’s your job.  I really would have preferred to just suck down a gallon a day and eat normally vs the sheer volume of food I was putting away.  I legit felt like I had been hit by a bomb through weeks 3 and 4, and finally managed to get a handle on things toward the end.

* If we wait until we feel good, we’ll never train.  I tore my hamstring before I was halfway done with the program, and up until the final workout it still ached.  It hurt LESS, sure, but I could still make an argument that I was injured at the final workout. And if I waited until I was “ready” to start again, I have no idea how long that would have taken.  Instead, I “went before I was ready”, squatted through pain, used knee wraps to fake a hamstring, took things slow, etc.  I genuinely do not feel I slowed down my healing rate in doing so: if anything, I sped it up, because I kept the muscle moving and gave it fresh blood.  In addition, I had zero “break back in” period.  Often, people that get injured and rest take FOREVER to get back because, upon their return, they’ll try out the movement that hurt them and still experience some pain in doing so, and they’ll freak out and go back to resting.  My continuing in my training, I effectively did my own rehab, getting the muscle from completely worthless to almost 100% functional, and didn’t miss any training as a result.

**BONUS SUPER SQUATS RAMBLING!**

* NOTE: What is written below are some jumbled thoughts I came up with toward the middle of my Super Squats run, so the timeline of thought processes may seem “off”.

* Going beyond 20 reps has been such a different way to make this program awful, and I feel like it just compliments things so well.  Just by nature of my injury I ended up doing 2 weeks of going up 5lbs a workout before resetting the weight to the start and then going up one REP a workout, and both progression models seem to work out pretty well.  I feel like there’s something to doing this intentional.  Perhaps running the program for 3 weeks where you go up 5lbs per workout, then reset and push max reps.  Another approach would be do 1 week going up 5 reps per workout, then hold that weight for the next week and go up a rep per workout and keep alternating that way.  A way to slow down the weight increases while still making things suck.  You might even do 10lb jumps during the weight increase weeks to compensate for the “down time”.  Another option would be 6 weeks one way, 6 weeks the other, with a program in the middle of course.  

* And then there’s alternate MOVEMENTS to include in there.  I’ve demonstrated that, at least ONE workout of “Super Good Mornings” is viable.  It’d be interesting to see what a full cycle would be like.  I also know that the book talks about hip belt squats, and from there the trap bar is a very logical transition.  And then we can combine that all with the above.  What about a week of good mornings where we progress weights, next week we take that top weight of good mornings and make it a squat week where we’re chasing after max reps, and then next week is a trap bar week?  Are we making conjugate Super Squats?  It’s a bit like Dogg Crapp, which, actually, would ALSO work just dandy here: change between 3 movements every workout.

* I’ve also entertained the idea of being cute and having a theme of “Paul Kelso Super Squats”.  Use the trap bar for presses, rows, trap bar lifts and SLDLs.  I’m literally thinking AS I write this and I realize I just came up with a (potentially) INCREDIBLY effective hypertrophy program with ONE piece of equipment and NO rack.  Just think of how space economic that is.  Biggest issue would be getting the trap bar in place for pressing without a rack, but that circus act CAN happen.  And using radar chest pulls, you don’t need a bench and dumbbell to get the pull over effect.  

* All THIS said, I REALLY don’t think the SSB meets intent here at all.  I feel like a BIG part of the “success” of this program Is having that bar just absolutely CRUSH you for all it’s worth and you just survive for as long as possible.  The SSB is too comfortable AND it allows you to stand there and take the pressure off of you by pushing it back or pulling it forward as needed.  You are ON the clock when it’s a barbell crushing you, and even with the trap bar with straps, you’re still standing there having it pull your shoulders out of the socket.  Don’t ask me about the belt squat: I have no idea how that’s supposed to work.

* I DO have to avoid for falling into the trap of making Super Squats the answer to everything.  I have to appreciate that this laser focused program was effective BECAUSE I came into it with SO much accumulated volume.  In that regard, I plan to do a write-up at some point of Super Squats and Deep Water being yin and yang.  Both absolutely crazy, but SO different in their insanity, making them ideal pairings.  3 days a week of 1x20 vs 1 day a week of 10x10.  Of course, the kind of dude that is just plain ALWAYS running Super Squats and Deep Water back to back is too crazy even for me.  At some point there would need to be some sort of OTHER side of balance, which would probably be a great time for a lighter 5/3/1 program, the 10K swing challenge, or something else just plain wildly different.",2022-12-16 16:22:18

**My 20s and 30s**

A call-center job chained to a desk, along with moving to a big city and eating amazing food, caused me to balloon from my teenage size to 300 lbs in my 20s. At my worst, I was eating ~4000 calories of trash a day, with no real veggies and very little protein. A typical breakfast was a stop at 7-11 for an extra-large iced mocha latte, two donuts and three deep fried taquitos. I would snack all day on Doritos and Dr Pepper. A typical supper was a 1200cal chicken parm sub. I had severe sleep apnea, various bowel issues, fucked up knees, constant back pain, rashes, irritated eyes and nose. I was a walking heart attack.

**Initial Weight Loss**

This is where the ""mistakes were made"" meme comes in, at least according to current wisdom. In 2015 at age 35 I went to the doctor, who determined that a) my blood pressure was moments away from a stroke and b) in her heavy French accent, ""we found some diabetes"" in my blood work. I asked her what to do, and thankfully she did not give me pills, but said ""lose weight."" I said I would.  Had a little cry in the car, and decided then and there to change.

It gets dicey here, because I googled the whole diabetes thing, and it sure seemed like sugar and simple carbs were to blame. Rather than take a reasonable approach, I dove head-long into Paleo, religious fervor and all. The good news? Cutting out carbs had immediate effect, and ""felt easy"", in that meals were still enjoyable. By pure willpower and my new belief that ""all sugar was poison,"" I quit everything else cold turkey. Drank water only, no more snacks, no more pop, nothing. I tracked everything with MyFitnessPal, which I still preach to this day (even if temporarily, to see where you're at). My daily caloric intake went down into the 1300-1500 calorie range. And I was very, very consistent.

The weight melted off. As I'm sure many would agree, too fast. 30 lbs in 2 weeks. 50-60 in about 3 months. From April to November I went from 300 lbs to 190. My only physical activity was walking. EVERY SINGLE DAY, no matter what, at least one hour, often two. Podcasts probably saved my life. Eventually, I worked my way up to jogging and then to running. Zero lifting. Most joint pain went away, bowels started working right, rashes and itchiness and disappeared. I ""cured"" the pre-diabetes, got my BP under control. After maintaining my weight for four years, I retired my CPAP machine. Went from a 44 waist to 32, 2XL shirts to Medium.

So this may all sound amazing, but the low-carb stuff and severe calorie restriction damaged my relationship with food and I still struggle a bit today (I'm happy to discuss this further in the comments). Also, because I didn't lift, I lost a ton of muscle, and looked kinda gaunt and flabby (see: pic of me in the red t-shirt.) I badly pulled my quad helping a friend move a couch, and realized I might've made some mistakes.

&nbsp;

**Starting Lifting**

Strength training began in late 2016 after talking with some friends about it. At first I just bought a shitty weight set for home and randomly did exercises, poorly. Eventually I got to talking with my friend Brandon, who's also an online S&C coach, and we started on a very beginner-friendly Functional Fitness program. I know that term has been beaten to death in online fitness over the years but considering my numerous mobility and joint issues, it was the right call. Simple bodyweight exercises to improve mobility (hip hinge drills, squat holds, T-spine mobility), lots of isometric work to build core strength (planks, dead bugs), and most importantly, work to strengthen my back using Stuart McGill's ""Big 3.""

&nbsp;

**Trail Running**

While beginning this, I still felt that I ""needed"" to run. My knees felt good. I moved up North and out to the country, and got further into trail running. This culminated in competing in my first race, a 7km trail run at Limberlost Forest. This is where my coach helped me understand that you don't need to run miles a day to have ""decent"" conditioning; he insisted I not go out and ""run 7km every day."" Instead, we did sprint drills on my rest days, 10sec on, 20sec off, as well as hill sprints. To my surprise, I felt good during the race and finished 77th out of 200+ entries.

It also made me realize that I don't really like running, and I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. So I haven't really gotten back into it since. The iron suits me better.

&nbsp;

**Current Training**

Because I started in my late 30s after 15yrs of destroying my body, there's a heavy focus on warm up and mobility work. Some on this sub might see it as busy work or junk volume, but it's all in the service of staying pain-free OR working around minor aches and pains, and improving on my limitations. I care about that more than I care about numbers on the bar. I don't back squat, for example--I either front squat or KB squat. There's a lot of Dan John and Mike Boyle influence.

The other day when I was sitting in a deep, long squat at work, a co-worker was asking me wtf I was doing. I said ""I'm squatting like this at 42 so I can squat like this at 82.""

Since I began weight training, I have missed zero training days. ZERO. In many cases I've delayed one by a day, and I've worked through and around minor injuries and sickness. When I travel I bring a kettlebell and I get work done. I've also lifted with COVID--perks of a home gym. No matter what, above all else, CONSISTENCY. Good workout, shit workout, just TRAIN. 80% effort the rest of your life is better than 100% effort half the time.

My current program consists of four 4-week blocks. First block is high rep work, second block is ramping reps, third block increases RPE, ramping upward each week, and fourth block ramps heavy maxes, no more than 5 reps on most lifts. Full-body 3x a week. I feel this suits me because I have no specific goals, and I don't compete. I have no idea what my 1RMs are and don't really care. I just want to progress. The programming is vaguely powerlifting-based, in that each day focuses on Bench, Deadlift, or Squat, but my coach is a kettlebell fiend, and I've fallen in love with them as well, so they factor in as often as the barbell.

I don't want to make the post even bigger than it already is, so I don't think I should post the entire program. But here's an example of this week, which is ramping RPE and includes complimentary plyo movements in a Giant Set:

&nbsp;

**Warmups**

* [MBSC Flow Warmup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brjs42oQ7FU&t=2s)
* Box Jumps, Side Planks, Hardstyle Planks, Cable Lifts and Cable Chops

&nbsp;

**Monday**

* 2KB Rack Squat 3x8 +Box Jump x5
* Pause Pushups 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* 1 Leg Hip Lift Isometric

&nbsp;

* 2KB Single Leg Deadlift 3x8
* Chin-Ups 3x8 +Ball Slam x5
* Standing 1-arm KB Press 3x6

&nbsp;

* 2KB Swing 5x15 to finish

&nbsp;

**Wednesday**

* Trap Bar Deadlift 3x10,5,5 +KB Swing x8
* Olympic Ring Row 3x8
* Pushup Walkout+Pushups (3x5,6,7,8 reps by week)

&nbsp;

* Skater Squat to 2 pads 3x5 (AMRAP last week)
* Incline DB Bench 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* Pallof Press (3x8,10,12,15 by week)

&nbsp;

* KB Clean and Press 2x8 to finish

&nbsp;

**Friday**

* 2KB Bulgarian Split Squat 3x8
* Bench Press 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* Ab Fallout (2x8,8,10,12 by week)

&nbsp;

* Goblet Lateral Lunge 3x8 +Goblet Squat x8
* Meadows Row 3x8 +Ball Slam x5
* Deficit Calf Raises (2x5,6,7,8 by week)

&nbsp;

* Poundstone Curls to failure x2
* Tricep Pullovers x2 to failure to Finish

&nbsp;

Note: my ""Finish"" varies wildly depending on what I want to do, and also weather. I often like to do heavy farmer's carries (bodyweight in each arm) to failure or sled pushes in the summer. In the winter I stick mostly to kettlebell complexes and just try and wear myself out.

Rest days are for active rest. I walk my dog daily, I do a ton of hiking and kayaking, and I'm thinking about buying a bike. I also work in auto parts so I spend most of my day on my feet, walking around a warehouse carrying things.

If I had to bro-guess my lifts (based on 5 rep maxes), they're around 385 on the deadlift, 190-200 bench, and 200 on the front squat.

&nbsp;

**Nutrition**

As mentioned before, my diet lost a ton of weight, but really messed with my eating habits.  After I hit my goal, I simply reintroduced more calories, but after lots of reading and getting to know the science better, I dropped the Paleo and started eating carbs again. But I STILL ""feared carbs,"" and tended to not eat as much as I should. I was sort of permanently hovering around 2000 calories until last year, worried about putting weight back on, worried about the bathroom scale, worried about carbs. I was always cold. I felt great in terms of strength and energy though.

My coach finally convinced me to just not look at the scale, and try to eat a bit more intuitively. The result? I gained like 1 lb over the course of a year, while recomping muscle a bit and looking better. Lifts went up. After that, we talked about adding more calories, mostly carbs. From my lowest weight of 183 (first shirtless pic), I've put on about 15 pounds, some of which I sure hope is muscle (last pic). If and when my pants get tight, I'll probably cut again. After all, I've done it before.

I really do consider my nutrition a strength now. I try not to track anymore, hovering around 2600-2800 calories. I shoot for 0.7-0.8g/lb of protein, which means 170-180g. I fill the rest in with carbs and fat, moreso carbs now, which is where I was lacking before. Breakfast every day is a protein shake with a scoop of whey isolate, spinach, fruit of some kind, creatine, and unsweetened almond milk, and a bowl of oatmeal. I meal prep lunches EVERY. SINGLE. SUNDAY no matter what. Lunch is 40-50g of protein, usually chicken or ground turkey, roasted potatoes or rice, and a veg like Broccoli. Small protein bar for a snack every single day, a cup of plain Greek yogurt most days, sometimes with chocolate chips or berries in it. Suppers are where I let loose and play around, I love to cook, but at their core is always 40-50g of protein. I try to keep red meat to once a week, usually a lean cut of steak. Post-workout dinners are often big breakfast plates with 3-4 eggs, egg whites, turkey bacon, roasted potatoes and a good multi-grain bread with peanut butter. To ""get my carbs in"" now, I'll have another bowl of oatmeal or a PB&J sandwich.

I drink only black coffee and water. I eat three big meals and two or three snacks every day. But I've also learned to live a little, my healthy habits are firmly in place so it's okay to eat junk now and then. A latte every now and then, a restaurant a couple times a month (usually a big breakfast). Occasionally a Halo Top ice cream. If I want a cookie or a donut, I have one. I still try to keep cheap snacks out of the house to prevent binging--if I want a treat, I have to go to the bakery and get a treat. Make it worth it.

I would say these are the four biggest tips I could give on nutrition: track what you eat (at LEAST for the first few months), have the occasional snack, don't drink your calories, and MEAL PREP. You ""can"" do a huge caloric deficit like I did and succeed, and then go back to eating somewhat normally, but most will fail in that.  Better to consistently reinforce good habits and drop the weight more slowly. For others, simply focusing on becoming stronger and more mobile while eating ""a bit better"" can be enough. More protein, more fibre, less junk.

&nbsp;

**Mental Health, Body Image**

This is still a daily struggle for me, even though I do feel some pride in what I accomplished. I struggle with anxiety, and looking back it was obvious I stress-ate. I've replaced the food with behavioural therapy, and trying to just relax more, get out in nature, get off social media, read more books.

I have loose skin, but as you can see in the pics it's not too bad now that I've put some muscle on. If I bend over, it still looks like melted cheese, but if I'm standing up, I have abs and my obliques even show up a little. I think since I started eating enough, my shoulders, chest and even traps have come in a little. My quads have grown very noticeably, and my wife says ""I have an ass now."" But body dysmorphia is real and I still think ""I'm getting too fat"" or ""my arms aren't big enough."" I just keep telling myself that consistency is all that matters. Show up and do the damn thing. I owe a lot to my coach, keeping me grounded and keeping my workouts interesting and challenging. I look forward to training.  I do this for overall fitness, health and well-being. I do this so I can still be moving and active and healthy in my 80s. I'm mostly pain free and I now have the knowledge to stay that way. I look, move and feel better at 42 than I did at 22.  It also encouraged my wife to eat better and exercise, and she's lost about 40 lbs from her heaviest! I couldn't be more proud of her.

I'm happy to answer further questions in the comments. Thanks for listening to my rambling!",2022-12-16 02:07:51

"""Comparison of Two Types of High-Intensity Interval Training: Heart Rate Based vs. Speed/Time Based"" DAE: have the same experience as these results?",4,zm8fub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zm8fub/comparison_of_two_types_of_highintensity_interval/,7,1671067805.0,"According to this study: https://brieflands.com/articles/asjsm-123355.html HIIT using HTHR is superior for targeting a workout. The work part had higher speed, while the rest period had lower speed.  

*""In this exercise, the heart rate of the subjects was visible on display at any time due to the wearing of a Polar heart rate monitor chest strap. The exercise started at 1 km/h, and every 20 seconds, 1 km/h was added to the treadmill speed to reach 90% of the maximum heart rate (HRmax). Immediately, the instantaneous speed and time elapsed from the start of the exercise were recorded. Then every 20 seconds, the treadmill speed was reduced by 1 km/h until the heart rate reached 55% of the maximum heart rate (HRmax). At this moment, the instantaneous speed and the time elapsed from the beginning of the exercise were recorded (19). This cycle lasted for 40 minutes. Heart rate was also recorded every 30 seconds throughout the workout.""*   

Conclusion: ""The work-to-recovery ratio seems to be more precisely controlled in HTHR... In general, in order to accurately control the intensity and recovery of acute training, the use of the heart rate index is more appropriate than the speed/time index.""   

However, the way the test was run for the HTHR is different from how I'd normally consider a HIIT workout. They slowly ramped up and down the treadmill speed based on heart rate, but in a real HIIT I would consider going 100% in effort until you hit the heart rate, and then going at a moderate pace until the heart rate came back down. 

I'm thinking about getting a chest heart rate monitor that is HIIT friendly and doing sets by max/min heart rate and bouncing between the two values.  

Does anyone have any personal experience with using a certain heart rate as the end goal of each set in HIIT?  

It seems superior to standard HIIT. And rather than finishing an exercise, and looking back at the data afterwards to perfect the NEXT workout in terms of optimal work/recovery times, you could simply have a perfect exercise THIS time. It would also lead to increased motivation to push each set as hard as possible, rather than simply surviving until the timer beeps. You can't stop working until you've worked hard enough long enough!

Any thoughts/comments/studies would be appreciated. The studies I've found don't quite manage to describe my intended workout routine.",2022-12-15 03:30:05

Review Of Fitness Studies VIII: Stretching For Muscle Growth? Pain? Beta-Alanine?,461,zix8xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zix8xn/review_of_fitness_studies_viii_stretching_for/,23,1670773983.0,"Hello! There was a time awhile ago where I had posted some summaries of journal articles on general fitness. The idea was to help condense important information and make it accessible to the layperson who simply wants to get healthy. I have had some free time recently and I figured I would share some cool papers I read. With this text, I hope that everyone can learn something and that a fruitful and interesting discussion can occur below. I will try my best to answer any queries people may have. Feel free to leave any criticism as well since writing educational content is a skill I am continuously trying to hone. I am not advertising any sort of product or premium access to whatever but if you would like to offer support beyond a comment in this thread, feel free to PM me. Enjoy!

---------------------------------------------------

Schoenfeld et al. (2022) wrote a review on the potential for stretching in between sets to be a time-efficient way to gain muscle. The theoretical basis for this novel practice consists of a few ideas. Firstly, our muscles contain many sensors that detect tension, both active and passive. We know that the active sensors are directly linked to pathways that are essential to muscle gain. We do not have much practical evidence that the passive sensors have the same links but it is possible. Other theories include flattening of the muscle cell nuclei (the control centre of the cell) and opening of specific channels in the muscle whenever we stretch. Again, this is all highly theoretical and we have yet to see any findings that explicitly demonstrate that these processes lead to muscle gain.

Upon the foundation of promising animal studies, there have been a few studies looking at humans using stretching during rest periods between sets to try to elicit more muscle gains. Unfortunately, the results are fairly equivocal when looking at the entirety of the data and most of the studies were all conducted a little differently. Van Every et al. (2022) carried out an experiment in which 21 young, untrained males performed a straight leg calf-raise on a leg press machine and a seated calf-raise for 4 sets each, twice a week for 8 weeks. If you would like to understand why they did these two exercises specifically, refer to the side-note below.

The catch in the study was that one calf would rest for 2 minutes between sets as one would usually do while the other calf would stretch for 30 seconds during the 2 minute rest period. The stretch would use the full load of their set. For example, if the participant was calf-raising 50 kilograms on the leg press, after the final repetition, they would keep the 50 kilograms on and immediately descend into a stretched position and hold it for 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the authors did not specify how “hard” the subjects should stretch. All the participants were familiarized with the exercises for a week prior to the exercise programme and they also did 10 repetition maximum testing to prescribe adequate loads. All sets were done to failure in the 8-12 repetition range. To observe muscle changes, the researchers used ultrasound scans and they also used a dynamometer to detect muscle strength adaptations. The ultrasound measures were conducted 48 hours away from exercise to prevent muscle swelling from influencing the observations.

The authors found that the soleus grew more in the calves that had been stretched during the inter-set rest periods. However, the range of differences between groups in soleus growth spans from absolutely no difference at all to a large difference. It should also be highlighted that we expect a range of error in measurement and the finding falls within this range so it is possible this difference was not real and can be attributed to lack of precision in ultrasound technique or interpretation. The strength changes were similar in that the stretch group had greater strength improvements but the variation in results was high. Other calf muscles did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups. If we assume the greater soleus growth to be true, it may be related to the soleus’ muscle architecture. It is composed of mainly type 1 fibers (low force production but high fatigue resistance) with shorter muscle fibers that are usually rather resistant to growth. While the results are not incredible, this low-risk method of training may help with the stubborn calf muscle gains and muscle growth in general.

Coming back to the review by Schoenfeld et al. (2022), they recommend that if you would like to implement stretches between sets, it should be done immediately after set completion. This is due to a phenomenon known as “residual force enhancement”. When we stretch a muscle under load as opposed to passively, it actually produces more tension. For example, instead of hopping off the calf-raise machine to do a stretch, it may be better to stay on the machine while putting yourself in the bottom, stretched position under the exercise workload. The authors advise to hold the stretch at at least an 8 on the rate of perceived exertion scale. It is also likely that stretching using the load you lift during the working sets is beneficial.

**TL;DR:** Stretching between sets is a novel idea that may be a time-efficient way to increase muscle growth. However, much more research is needed.

**Side-Note:**
The seated calf-raise allows for better targeting of the soleus muscle, the muscle deeper in the calf. To understand why this happens, we must grasp some mechanical concepts of the muscle. A muscle is able to produce the most force at certain lengths. If the muscle is too taut or too slack, it is unable to create as much force. In the science world, this is referred to as the muscle length-tension relationship.

Basically, this is because for force production to occur, proteins in our muscles need to form bridges. When the muscle is too taut or too slack, the bridges are not able to be properly built resulting in low force production. Keeping that in mind, let us take a look at the gastrocnemius, which is the calf muscle that lies on top of your soleus muscle. The gastrocnemius originates from a bone in your thigh, above and behind your knee. It travels down the back of your leg and attaches behind your heel. 

You can pretend that this muscle is a string that is attached between these two points. Now imagine pulling on this string and two things should happen. One, your ankle will bend which causes your toes to be pointed forward like a ballerina. Second, your knee will bend. So what is special about the gastrocnemius is that it is able to perform movements at both the knee and the ankle. However, if for example, the gastrocnemius is helping the knee bend to a great degree, like in a seated calf raise, that means that the gastrocnemius is shortening a lot. If you remember what was mentioned earlier, this means that the gastrocnemius is now at a length where it cannot produce a lot of force because of how shortened it has become. So if I were to now ask the gastrocnemius to do an ankle movement, like a seated calf raise, it would be difficult as it cannot produce much force at an already shortened length. How are we able to do a seated calf raise then? Luckily, the soleus does not attach above the knee so its length is unaffected when we bend or straighten our knee. Thus, the soleus is the main provider of force to complete the seated calf raise. This phenomenon that the gastrocnemius muscle encounters (and many others muscles as well!) is called “active insufficiency”. We are able to use active insufficiency to our advantage in many cases but perhaps we can cover that another time.

The next paper we are covering is by Harvie et al. (2015) in which they explore how visual feedback affects the pain experience. Regardless if you are active or sedentary, you are bound to encounter injuries in your life. Naturally, pain is associated with these injuries and the pain sensation comes in a variety of forms. Everyone will have their own unique stories with pain and this paper will serve as an excellent tool to understanding more about how pain works and what factors affect the feeling of pain.

The researchers recruited 24 people with chronic neck pain and had them perform neck rotations while wearing a virtual reality headset. The participants would be seated in a chair with a belt strapped around their body at the shoulders to isolate the neck rotation. The virtual reality headset allowed the experimenters to adjust the rotation speed of the virtual environment. For example, if they were to slow down the virtual rotation speed and you turned your head 45 degrees, it may only look like you have turned your head 35 degrees because the rotation in the virtual world is so slow. The researchers created three different conditions that each subject went through. The first was under normal settings where the virtual reality rotation and real-life rotation were matched 1 to 1. The other conditions involved either the virtual rotation being slower or faster than real-life rotation by 20%. 20% was chosen because in a previous study, people could tell that virtual rotation speeds had been adjusted if they went beyond 20% in either direction. Each subject would do 6 rotations to both sides under each condition and indicate their pain level on a 0-10 scale. Computer programs would measure how far people were able to rotate their necks before the onset of pain. The virtual environment was also different for every condition to prevent people from using visual cues as an anchor for maintaining the same rotation every time.

It was found that when the virtual rotation speed was slower than real life, people were able to rotate their necks further by about 6% before the onset of pain. When the virtual rotation speed was faster, the pain-free range of motion of neck rotation was 7% less on average. These findings indicate that what we see plays a part in how we experience pain. Over the years, we have come to understand that pain is a protective alarm system that the body uses to alert us of a threat. This threat can arise from a multitude of sources. If we get punched in the face, tissues likely get damaged and our body produces pain since the damage has created a threat. In response, we may cover our face, go hide or seek treatment as we would like to protect ourselves. However, we can feel pain even when there is no tissue damage at all as long as our brain is perceiving something as a threat. Perhaps we are not sleeping well as we are stressed about an upcoming exam and suddenly we experience knee pain in a knee that was injured years ago but has healed since then. What if we open up the knee and find that there is absolutely no tissue damage? How is it possible that the knee is feeling any pain at all? Well the stress from the poor sleep and exam has built up and has become a threat to us as perceived by the brain which can accentuate pain from acute or chronic injuries.

In the study, the brain sees that the neck has been rotated too much and elicits a pain response in your body. This is to protect you because it believes that if you rotate too much, you will over-stress the tissue and cause further damage. The brain is likely wrong in this case but the protective system exists nonetheless. However, the brain depends on several factors before producing pain. In this case, it is clear that it is using visual feedback to create pain. Altering the visual feedback thus changes the pain sensation accordingly. In our lives, however, pain modulation goes beyond visual feedback. An eloquent analogy I picked up from Barbell Medicine is that pain is like hunger. If you just went through a break-up, you might go through a whole tub of ice cream in one sitting. If you are out with friends you might eat more as well. There are many influences on how hungry you are and the same idea goes for pain. That is why it is incredibly important that when you are evaluating your pain, consider not only what may be happening physically or biologically but also consider what is happening psychologically or socially. Family issues? Problems at work? Feeling depressed lately? All of these examples have the capacity to moderate the pain you feel and it will be unique to each person.

**TL;DR:** Pain is the product of a system run by your brain to protect you from threats. Threats can be physical, mental, emotional and social. Pain is like hunger, several things can influence either sensation. This study used virtual reality to alter what we see and by extension, change our pain experience.

Beta-alanine is likely a supplement we have all heard about and consumed especially if you use pre-workout formulas. Let’s take a look at a meta-analysis conducted by Saunders et al. (2017) to get a better idea of what beta-alanine is and to explore its effectiveness in muscle performance. A meta-analysis is essentially a process in which multiple studies are put together to consolidate all their findings into one massive study. This helps us discover relationships that would not be possible to uncover in one study alone. Before we get into the potential performance effects, let us briefly look over how beta alanine works. As we exercise, muscles become more acidic over time which results in poorer performance. Carnosine is a protein found in our muscles and it is important for several reasons, one of which is to manage how acidic or alkaline our muscles get. Carnosine is actually partly made up of beta alanine and thus beta alanine is also necessary to prevent our muscles from getting too acidic. Knowing all this, it is clear that beta alanine may have a potential benefit in boosting muscular endurance but is that really the case?

The meta-analysis found that there was a small benefit in exercise performance done over a minute and beyond. If we go below a minute - especially under 30 seconds - we do not really see any meaningful ergogenic use. This makes sense as intense activities that are short in duration will not be limited by how acidic our muscles are. The effects of beta alanine seem to be much more evident in exercises that are performed to failure rather than exercises that are not. Whether or not you are a novice or an experienced athlete, beta alanine appears to exhibit the same effects. The type of exercise also has no bearing on beta alanine and its function. The authors also did analysis on sodium bicarbonate and effects on performance when co-supplemented with beta-alanine. Sodium bicarbonate has similar mechanisms for improving endurance in that it also manages the acidity of muscles. It was discovered that sodium bicarbonate had a slightly better boost to performance when taken with beta alanine compared to taking beta alanine alone. Perhaps we can take a deeper dive into sodium bicarbonate another time as it presents some promise and other research into the compound has been done since this meta-analysis.

While there is likely a small benefit to muscular endurance when supplementing with beta alanine, it is important that these improvements are only apparent when taking doses over a period of time. Taking an acute dose, in your pre-workout for example, will do nothing for performance. The authors suggest taking 3.2-6.4 grams per day for 4 to 12 weeks with the doses spread across the day (0.8-1.6 grams every few hours). The spaces between doses help prevent the occurrence of unwanted side effects like tingling sensations.

**TL;DR:** Beta alanine likely offers a small boost to muscular endurance in activities that go beyond 30 seconds to 1 minute. You can consider supplementing with 3.2-6.4 grams per day for 4 to 12 weeks with the doses spread across the day (0.8-1.6 grams every few hours) if it is safe for you to consume.

What's the point of having people guess your body fat?

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Back in the day, there was this really nice IIFYM calculator where you put in the usual stuff (current goal weight, activity levels, age/height, etc) and it spits out your macros, with recommended recipes to meet them. You could even put in dietary preferences and reject certain recipes where it will re-generate that specific thing based on any changes you make. 


Unfortunately, I can't find this site anymore since I don't recall the name, and searching here and elsewhere is only finding me calculators that simply just compute the macro ratios and that's it.

Can We Talk About Zone 2 Cardio?,6,z9imhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/z9imhq/can_we_talk_about_zone_2_cardio/,15,1669883406.0,"I’ve heard from several sources that I typically trust and respect that 80% of weekly cardio should be performed at 65%-75% (Zone 2) of your maximum heart rate in order to optimize performance.

My typical week looks something like the following:

M/W/F AM: 60 Min Bike Ride Entirely at Zone 2 (65%-75%)
M/W/F PM : 60 Min HIIT Class (Probably 45 min in Zones 3 & 4 via intervals of constant moderate weight training and cardio)
Tu/Thu: 30-45 Min Spin Class (Zones 3 & 4)

I’m finding adjusting my current regime to fit this guidance a somewhat ridiculous ask as it would mean either adding an additional 9 hours of Zone 2 Cardio or scrapping all but one of my Zone 3&4 workouts.

I suppose what I’m asking is what views do people have on the role of zone 2 cardio as it relates to performance? Should it be implemented as a % of total cardio or is a certain # of mins per week adequate?",2022-12-01 10:30:06

This is my first progress post here and I wanted to share the details of my journey, my struggles, what worked best for me and some recommendations. I love helping people out so feel free to DM or ask below any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

**PHOTOS:**

[Weight Loss Progression](https://imgur.com/Viu7xYb)

[Back Progress](https://imgur.com/a/APtkOK7)

**GETTING STARTED (FIRST 60 LBS) JUST DIET/NO LIFTING:**

Back in 2018 I was going through a lot of anxiety and I was using food as my escape binge eating on a regular basis. I always wanted to lose weight, but I could never stick to a diet. I also had a bad case of last supper effect in which I would put a future date on starting a diet (usually a Monday) and then eat anything I could get my hands on to enjoy myself before the diet. This repeated itself multiple times which is when I actually gained 30lbs within 2-3 months. I was taking anti-acid more than once a day and I would be tired all the time.

Right after Thanksgiving 2018, I decided that I needed to do something about this and my mom recommended Keto. After starting Keto, my cravings pretty much got eliminated and I felt I was happy in that diet. Of course, it helps that Keto makes you lose a good amount of water weight which is motivating when starting out. I stayed on Keto and lost 60lbs within 4 months. ([First Progress Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/b680rg/m2157_260lbs_205lbs_55lbs_4_months_still_got_ways/)) and plateaued my way at the 200 +- 10lbs for a year. I also incorporated a couple of fasting days here (16,18, 23). However, during this time I cheated on the diet multiple times so I stayed the same throughout the year.

**DEC 2019 STARTED LIFTING/COVID :**

[Pic](https://imgur.com/ZMzxt0m). I stared going to the gym with my roommate and he pretty much became my trainer and mentor at that point. At first he would pressure me to go but then I started actually liking going to the gym so it would be me the one that would pressure him. I went 3-4x per week until March 2020 when COVID hit. Diet was a disaster at this point, the gym helped lower the damage but I was still gaining weight. Then COVID hit and the gyms started to close.

**2020 SERIOUS LIFTING/COVID**

During March-June 2020 of COVID I was doing Keto and Fasting and went as far down as 180lbs but quickly yo-yoed myself back to the 190-200 range by July. The gyms started opening again which in when I started going religiously 5-6x per week. I didn't have my roommate to go with my so I got an app (FitBod) that guided me through a routine and started watching lots of videos on youtube. Here's the thing about watching videos on youtube, there's a lot of bro science out there and with time I felt more confused than ever. Wondering if I was wasting my time lifting weights while being in a deficit. I started getting overwhelmed but decided to keep at it and keep trying to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time against the advise of a lot of online ""experts"". I stayed consistent with the gym, diet was still a struggle and I was building muscle but not losing much fat.

**2021-PRESENT JUST FASTING/LIFTING**

As 2021 rolled in I stopped doing Keto. I had moved back with my friends and it was a struggle to have a social life with Keto when no one else was doing Keto. Fasting was giving me more options on what I would eat (within reason) during the window. This proved a better strategy for me at this stage and it proved successful because I lost the dreaded 30lbs to 170 here. Lifting stayed consistent here, no issues with that. Did a bit of orange theory that actually helped but sometimes I would unconsciously eat more than if I had not gone at all.

**PROGRAM**

I do push, pull, legs and switch things up but here's a sample routine. I no longer do shoulders with push because my shoulders aren't very strong so it's too much to take with chest. Instead I do shoulders with legs or on a separate day with triceps. (Note, these say 4 sets, I always do one warm up set with very little weight so it's really 3 sets). The ones that say 3 sets don't have warm ups.

**Monday - Push (Chest/Triceps)**

* 4x12-8 Barbell Bench Press
   * Warm Up: Barbell 45 lbs (8+ reps)
   * Warm Up 2: 135lbs (8 reps)
   * 155lbs (12 reps)
   * 185lbs (10 reps)
   * 205lbs (8 reps)
* 3x13-10 Dips
* 3x15+ Incline Push Up
* 3x10+ Incline Tricep Push Up (or cable overhead tricep extension)
* 4x12-8 Dumbbell Incline Bench Press (or barbell)
* 4x12-10 Dumbbell Kickbacks (or cable one arm tricep push down)
* 3x12-8 Machine Fly (or cable fly)

**Tuesday - Pull (Biceps/Back)**

* 4x8-12 Dumbbell Bicep Curls
* 2x6-10 Pull Ups
* 2x8-12 Chin Ups
* 4x12 Hanging Knee Raise (I always finish pull/chin ups with this, even it not doing abs)
* 4x8-12 Hammer Curls
* 4x12-8 Dumbbell Row (or cable row)
* 3x12 Cable double bicep curl (or ez-bar curl)

**Wednesday - Cardio/Legs**

* 4x12-8 Deadlift
* 4x12-8 Squat
* 4x12-8 Leg Extensions
* 4x12-8 Leg Curl
* 4x12-8 Machine hip adductor
* 4x12-8 Machine hip abductor
* 4x12-8 Leg Press
* 10-12 minutes Stair Master (2min 6, 2min 8, 2 min 10, then back down)
* 25 minutes HIIT Treadmill (real honest I just do a tread sample from the orange theory subreddit)

**Thursday - Shoulders/Abs/Optional Triceps**

**Friday - Push 02 - Biceps/Back**

See above. When I repeat days I do a heavy lift day with less reps more weight. The second day I'll do lots of reps and lower weight with drop sets.  Example:

* 4x18-10ish Dumbbell Bicep Curls Drop Sets
* 2x8+ Pull Ups
* 2x8+ Chin Ups
* 4x12+ Hanging Knee Raise (I always finish pull/chin ups with this, even it not doing abs)
* 4x18-12ish Hammer Curls Drop Sets
* 4x18-10ish Dumbbell Row (or cable row) drop sets
* 3x20-15 Cable double bicep curl (or ez-bar curl)

**Saturday - Rest/Repeat Legs or Chest**

**Sunday - Rest**

**DIET**

Currently I'm just doing fasting (16, 18, 23) depending on how I'm feeling. With fasting I don't have to count every single calorie but I am conscious of them. With that being said, I'm terrible at counting calories and I always underestimate. Instead, I just overestimate the calories on everything I eat. So I go to Chipotle, their website says my bowl is 1,000 calories. I count 1,200 calories.  This is how I treat calories: I love money and not spending it, so I treat calories like money. My TDEE is 2,100 calories per day. I can choose how I spend that but if I go over my daily, then now I'm in debt. If I save up today then I have some savings. If I save up 200 every day then on the weekend I can redeem that for a Crumbl cookie or something like that.

With that being said, I do pay attention to my protein intake. I eat about 120g of protein. I don't sacrifice protein for a fast. So if I need a high protein yogurt or a shake after the gym, I'll break my fast for that and only for that and then immediately ""resume the fast"".

**SUPPLEMENTS:** Creatine, Protein, Pre-workout.

**LOSE SKIN:**  It's [not too noticeable](https://imgur.com/a/qcHqPs0) but the skin is very elastic and you can tell if you pull on it or lay down. I do have stretch marks (battle scars) on my side and some white ones in the stomach but those aren’t too noticeable. If I lose a couple more pounds it would be a lot more noticeable which is why I think I'll stay in the 170 range rather than pushing to 160 (unless I can increase mass)

**MENTAL HEALTH**

Didn't want to talk about this here but it's a crucial part of my journey so I'll briefly talk about it. A drastic transformation in relatively little time is not easy mentally speaking. It's like fast forwarding in social statuses from one night to the next. You sill feel the same on the inside but everyone treats you different and like you're worth more. Women that wouldn't speak to me 2 years ago now suddenly seem interested. You start getting compliments and don't even now how to react because no one never complimented your physical appearance before. Self confidence is still catching up and doesn't happen overnight. When you spend so much time working for a goal, it can also be easy to start focusing on imperfections (body dysphormia) so that's something that I've been working on as well. The point is that the mind is a muscle and problems don't get solved overnight. Training and mental development is required and a crucial part of a transformation.",2022-11-27 22:10:00

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

obligatory to start: yes, i have spoken to my doctor, and we have discussed which equipment and workouts are safe for me.

the thing is, i could really benefit from using my local gym as a resource, but i use a rollator walker. i don't really know how to be polite and out of the way, as i will need it beside me to help me transfer between equipment. i would leave it up front with staff if i could.

are there specific disabled sections in gyms for people with mobility aides? or is there usually enough room between equipment that i shouldn't worry? as far as i can remember, i have seen treadmills and the like really close together, but this was before COVID. would people consider it rude for my walker to be beside me and ""in the way""? i haven't been in a gym since my diagnosis, so i just don't know how things will work.

i will definitely ask staff questions when i get the courage to try, i just honestly doubt there is much of a 'game plan' at any gym for people in my position. if anyone has experience or can help me know what to expect, please comment!! i have been exercising more, slowly, at home and outdoors, but my worries are keeping me from seeking out the gym.

here's to hoping r/disabilityfitness opens up again soon so i can crosspost there.",2022-11-16 21:03:42

On leg and glute-centered days, I try to incorporate glute activation exercises before lifting -  unweighted fire hydrants, kick backs, donkey kicks, and side leg circles. I want to be effective in activating the muscle I'm training but I'm really confused about the necessity of glute activation, the extent of it and many reps I should aim for with activation.

Does progressive overload apply to glute activation too? How much activation is necessary?

 I've also seen and heard of people doing around 3 sets of 30 reps with activation (of the glute activation exercises mentioned above) - is this generally acceptable? The purpose of glute activation isn't to exhaust your glutes so how do you know when you've sufficiently activated those muscles to avoid overworking them with a workout and lifting after?",2022-11-16 07:47:34

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

Flesh & Metal Program Overview/Review,323,yrr62l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yrr62l/flesh_metal_program_overviewreview/,110,1668112706.0,"I am wrapping up three months of bulking while running my flexible program Flesh & Metal. I caught covid in the last weeks which killed momentum and put me in a little bit of a limbo while I prepared for a cutting period but I still accumulated enough positive results to call the program a success. This write up will cover my results, an overview of the program as I suggest others use it, and a recap of my three month run. Flesh & Metal is appropriate for lifters of any strength level, but requires the user to make decisions pertaining to movements used and accessory work. It is a flexible programming approach which means it can be made to work for a wide variety of training goals and situations but it will not tell you explicitly what to do, so it may not be appropriate for trainees without a basic understanding of what works for them yet. 

**Results**:

Here are some notable PR’s from the three months:

I don’t have before and after photos, [I am already huge]( https://imgur.com/a/83FQOmX), so I do not gain significant muscle from each bulk anymore, I am lucky to be a couple pounds heavier every *year* at this point. Bulk just puts on a few BF% for the most part and a sliver of muscle. You’ll have to trust me that I know what needs to be done to gain muscle and that this program enables that. 
If all of this doesn’t convince you that I probably know what I am doing then you do not need to keep reading if you don’t want to. I won’t be upset. 

**The Program**:

To give the brief elevator pitch, Flesh & Metal (F&M) is a loosely structured training methodology meant to be easily molded. It can be run with any set up, for any length of time, and can focus on whatever you need it to. Its core philosophy is to push for a PR in your current movements every session then move on to new movements when you hit a plateau. The ‘program’ leaves many choices, including what those movements are, what your accessory work is, how many days you want to train, and many other areas up to the user. It is meant to be more of an inspiration/driving force rather than a comprehensive program, and thus might not be appropriate for newer lifters who do not have experience handling these areas for themselves. 

***Progression Scheme:*** 

F&M is centered around two core movements each day. The progression scheme for your core movements is as follows:

-Select your primary movement, and on its initial session push it for a hard set at a weight/rep range of your choice. This set should probably not end in grinding reps, you want a pretty clean set as a starting point. 

-For each subsequent session with this movement, you must achieve a PR in one or more of these ways: increased reps, increased weight, or increase in estimated 1RM (this option is only available if the weight is increased, you can use whatever calculator/formula you want, just be consistent).

-Continue to advance the movement every session until you fail to achieve a PR by the above standards. When this happens, the movement is relegated to the ‘secondary’ position, and your current secondary movement (if you have one), is dropped entirely. 

-Choose a new primary movement for the next session, and lather, rinse, repeat. 

***Session/Weekly Structure:***

Every session will start with your primary movement. Build up to and complete the PR attempt top set. I suggest including either build up, or back off sets for the primary movement. These should be relatively easy, compared to the top set. I suggest going with ~1/2 the reps you will be attempting for the top set, using the top set weight. 2-4 of these sets is probably fine. After this you will move to the secondary movement. Here you just want the 2-4 straight sets, at roughly 80% what your best PR was. This can be 80% weight, or reps, or something in between. The point is to have hard but doable sets, the goal here being to ‘lock in’ what you developed when pushing the movement for PRs. After these core movements you will perform your chosen accessory work.

How many days a week you train is up to you, but I recommend having a separate set of primary/secondary movements for every 2 days you train. For example, a 4 day structure would look [something like this]( https://imgur.com/a/Cb46iSY)

I think that in most cases 4 or 6 sessions a week is the right choice for this program. But odd numbers are doable, just keep moving down the ABABAB or ABCABCABC pattern regardless of the day of the week. You can also incorporate days that are not part of the program. For example you could run 2 or 4 F&M days a week and then several days of something else. 

When choosing movements choose variations you are not super familiar with, or have not focused on in a long time. One of the main purposes for this methodology is to take advantage of rapid potential for improvement when learning, or refreshing, a movement, and the fact that it provides a wide variety of stimuli. Rotating a small pool of movements or movements you frequently work is not in line with this. Simple variants, like using a new bar, or a different grip, or a different Range of Motion, are all good ways to achieve this without going to completely new movements. 

I think that keeping a pairing of upper body primary with lower body secondary, and vice versa, is the best practice here, but you are free to go against that if you wish to adhere to a more rigid split. Similarly, keeping each session's movements in a similar pattern, such as the example week with Overhead Press paired with a Hinge, and a Horizontal Press paired with a Squat, is a good idea too. This helps ensure you are not performing similar movement patterns on back to back days. 

***Rationale:***

F&M is set up as it is for several reasons:

-Versatility: this is a program that has zero equipment requirements/limitations, can be made to fit a training block of any length, and can fulfill any general training needs. It will not prepare you for specific goals as well as a more specialized program but can be molded to fit anyone’s ‘off season’. 

-Sustainability: By the very nature of this program sustained plateaus will not happen. You can run this program indefinitely and you will never run into a wall. Granted, this opens up the possibility to sandbag and spin your wheels, but that is a possibility in most any program, even if this one won’t rub your face in it. 

-Injury Prevention: I pretty firmly believe that injury is primarily the result of overuse in the form of long-term load mismanagement. While a specific incident might push an area over the edge into injury, there is almost always a building issue in that area that precipitates that incident. By regularly cycling movements it is much more difficult to overwork specific areas to the point of injury, as they are not being pounded by the same stimuli day in and day out. 

Novelty: By incorporating so many movement patterns into your training you are likely to be choosing some that work your body in ways it has not worked before, or at least in ways that it does not get worked frequently. This can help develop undertrained areas you were not even aware you had. 

***General Suggestions:***

-This program is appropriate for either a bulk or a cut, but choose your degree of accessory volume and/or the intensity of your build up/back off and secondary sets appropriately. When cutting these all should be lower, when bulking higher. 

-Do not go as hard as possible every session on the top set of your primary movement. You will reach the point of grinding soon enough, don’t speed that process. Doing so will not only force you to switch movements more rapidly, but also lose some of the inherent periodization of the program which could interfere with fatigue management. Your goal should be to chip your previous PR, not blow it out of the water. 

-If you do feel that fatigue is eclipsing your recovery, consider choosing movements that are more technically or mechanically challenging for a while, as they will require lower absolute loads and will likely cause less overall fatigue. 

-Consider tracking at least your primary movements in a notebook or spreadsheet. You will be setting a lot of PRs while running this program, and you might want to be able to reference them later. 

***Inspirations:***

This program has multiple inspirations, and unlike someone claiming that their programming is totally novel (it’s not) I will gladly talk about them. 

-Average To Savage 2.0, Greg Nuckols: I think that A2S2 is one of the best general-purpose programs out there. After running it in 2020 the combination of a lower and an upper body compound a day, and the incorporation of multiple variants as primary movements really stuck with me. Its approach of buildup/back off sets with a singular top set is not unique, but this was the program that exposed me to it. 

-The Wisconsin Method, Eric Bugenhagen: This is relatively obscure, and frankly the information is so scattered and that I cannot really point to anything or guarantee that I am properly attributing the ideas, but the concepts were presented to me with this name and attributed to the Bugez. In short, it’s the same basic principle, but with even less structure and more Bugez intensanity. My main takeaway was the idea of pushing to PR every time and moving onto a new movement when you failed to do so was from these various posts/videos. 

-Many Other People: It would take a while to list them all, and I would probably miss some, but there are a lot of people who helped put the idea of expanding your scope for PRs, training with high variation, and putting your focus on training hard and constantly rather than getting lost in specifics and living in a world of %s and Squat, Bench, Dead. Everything that I write to you is inspired in part or in full by those around me (usually in a metaphorical sense, as most of it is online interaction). I just aim to collect this wisdom, internalize it, then release it into the wild with my own spin so that it might spread farther and continue the cycle. 

**Recap of my Run:**

I ran F&M for just shy of three months, with covid messing up the planned weeks 12 and 13. My weekly structure was as follows:

-Monday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Tuesday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Wednesday: Upper Body Hypertrophy 

-Thursday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Friday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Saturday: Lower Body Hypertrophy 

-Sunday: Arm Hypertrophy 

The core movements I worked through were: 

-Overhead Press: Clean and Jerk, Behind the Neck Strict Press

-Hip Hinge: Zercher Deadlift, Single Leg Deadlift (Frame)

-Horizontal Press: Larsen Press, Slingshot Bench

-Squat: Marrs Bar Box Squat 

[Here is the whole tracking spreadsheet of weights used/reps achieved]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n64f9XNKrNDfAXWTqGisgpTBsHq0_VY0ojnt2Zb_34k/edit?usp=sharing)

Accessory Movements were fairly minimal on F&M days. Training every day requires acceptance that some days won’t have a ton of work. I went in *intending* to follow a similar Upper, Lower, Arms pattern with one day off accessory work but ended up just hitting each day however I wanted. 

As I am wont to do, I went off and maxed weird stuff instead of accessories on many days, but I completed at least the primary movement on nearly every scheduled day. My adherence to the secondary movement was hit or miss. I do believe it is a good idea, so this is an area of do as I say not as I do. I doubt many of you are as inclined to explore the depths of esoteric and Avant Garde lifts so you will probably not have to worry about being distracted by a Yoke Arthur Clean. 

The hypertrophy days were performed at a local commercial gym. I like the pattern of including three days at the gym dedicated to hypertrophy work in my bulks. It keeps me from getting too far off track doing weird shit, as the ultimate goal of every bulk is to milk whatever extra muscle gain I can. A guarantee of three days a week where I focus on getting the volume in boring lifts needed to do that goes a long way towards meeting that goal.
 I also like the large variety of machines available at the gym. I am a firm believer in the value of machines to accumulate additional, more focused, volume for muscle groups you want to grow. Fixed movement patterns let you hit the muscles you want despite fatigue, and let you circumvent the smaller muscle groups/joints/connective tissues that can be beaten up with free weight work. People who completely eschew machine work in their training because they believe it’s inferior are silly. Machines have value for every kind of lifting related goal. 

Upper Body Days are general alternating movements for back and chest, usually following a pattern of heavier/more compound to lighter/more isolative, shoulder finishers included at the end when I remember. As example, an upper body day might look like Smith Machine Press, Heavy Single Arm Chest Supported Row, Converging Chest Press Machine, Lat Pulldown, Chest Fly, Cable Lateral Raises. Most of these end up in the 10-20 rep range. Not because I believe that range is special, it’s just what feels best for me. 3-4 sets per movement. 

Lower Body Days follow a pretty defined pattern for me these days. Leg Curls, building from warmup to a heavy top set. Leg Press or Hack Squat, which is just a single heavy top set with intensity modifier (drop set, rest pause set, cluster set, etc. Basically, anything that takes the set past traditional failure). Then I get sets of cable crunches, these are super useful because depending on the day I might have a serious lower back pump from the previous work, cable crunches do a good job of cooling that area down. Then I work obligatory calf work and finish up with a quad focused isolation like leg extensions or Bulgarian split squats. 

Arm Days are just 3 sets of Bi/Tri movements alternated. I incorporate a dedicated arm day in my bulks because arms (at least mine) need the dedicated work and because it’s a very low fatigue day, which is valuable when I am trying to maintain 7 workouts a week. I don’t have many specifics to cover here, I am not someone to be asking about growing arms. 

I walk 3 miles twice a day with my dog as general LISS cardio, I think that getting extra walking in is pure upside regardless of how you are training/what your goals are. Helps with recovery by getting blood moving and helps maintain an effortless cardiovascular base. I also row a 5k a couple times a week when bulking, in contrast to almost every night when cutting. It fulfills the need for slightly more intense cardio. 

I eat over 6000 calories a day to support all of this activity at my size (6’5’’ 265lbs +/-10). As I figure someone will ask if I don’t mention this. All of which is solid food. 

**Conclusion:**

I am glad that this loose form program panned out. I can now add it to my tiny but growing library of programming options that I have been building up. While I probably don’t personally need to write out and structure my programming ideas to make them work for me, doing it helps me better understand *why* I do the things I do, and thus more easily communicate the ideas to others. If what I have presented here has sparked your interest I have a largeish library of write ups including [long]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZdILLezOnR9UWXK6w8tW29SgFJNzyyw) and [longer]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1koNt2c_o4TN74QyGgm7bEKU9tRiQUuCb) writings.

First time posting here. I have very, very little free time for a variety of reasons (primarily the fact that both my wife and I work full time and we have three young children -- 2, 4, and 6).

Do you have any advice or recommend any resources for how to prioritize workouts starting from the least amount of time available and building up from there?

For example, what kind of workouts should I prioritize if I only have 30 minutes vs 60 minutes vs 90 minutes a week to exercise? What kind of workouts should I prioritize if I only have 5 minutes a day vs 10 minutes a day vs 15 minutes a day?

I want to have a baseline that I commit to and slowly build up from but keep that baseline as a fallback for when my schedule gets really hectic.

My goals are primarily weight loss, general fitness, and longevity. I'm 37. I'd like to lose around 40 pounds.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Long time lurker first time poster here in r/Fitness. 

A brief background on myself and my fitness experience: 

My entire life up until my sophomore year of college I played sports. Mainly football and baseball with some powerlifting sprinkled in during the offseason. During my years in college I studied for and completed my Masters of Exercise Physiology. I spent the few years after college competing in powerlifting and helping others improve their strength and overall fitness. Fast forward 4-5 years and I fell off VERY hard. Started avoiding the gym, eating terrible food and just isolating myself. It took me until around 1/1/2021 to finally get myself together and make a change. The heaviest weight I saw on the scale was 410 pounds but that was after getting back in the gym for 2 months! 

I am fortunate that I have the knowledge of how to train as well as the knowledge of how to lose weight which I why I wanted to share my story so far with you guys!

**WEIGHT:**

410lb (186KG) to 263lb (119.5KG)

The timeframe for this process so far is 1/1/2021 through today, 11/4/2022  


**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

On 10/28/2021 I suffered a full thickness tear in my left pec. This tear took place at the musculotendinous junction and after discussing with my doctor we both decided surgery was not the best option at this time. At the time of the tear I was down from 410+ pounds to around 330 pounds. 

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 605lb (275kg) to 675lb (306.8.5kg)

**Deadlift (Trap Bar):** 650lb (295kg) to 815lb (370kg)

**Bench (Pre tear):** 405lb (184kg) to 505lb (229kg)

**Bench (Post tear):** 95lb (43kg) to 415lb (188.6kg)

**OHP:** 225lb (102kg) to 345lb (156kg)

**Squat:** 605lb (275kg) to 705lb (320kg)

&#x200B;

**PROGRAM**

As many of you know the number one factor that determines metabolic rate is the amount of lean mass, mainly lean muscle mass, that you are holding. Because of this fact, my goal for this process was simple, build as much muscle as possible while also eating as clean as possible. I knew this would not be a fast process, but I also knew that this method would be the most sustainable and over time produce the best results.

I did not follow a strict split or even a strict workout routine, but rather I set frequency goals and stuck to them. The template for my routine is as follows:

* Resistance training 6 days / week
* Cardio 6 days / week
* Rest 1 day/ week (with light 30 min walk)

As for duration and muscle group frequency:

* Each lift is between 1.5-2 hours
* I always take AT LEAST 48 hours between training a muscle
* Cardio is typically 60 minutes per day (treadmill, stepper, elliptical) unless it is leg day, then cardio is 30 minutes
* I always try to do legs 2x per week.

Types of exercises:

* I stick to standard hypertrophy style movements and rep ranges (5x10, 5x12, 3x15, etc)
* In addition to the hypertrophy style movements I also try to do at least one power movement per workout (bench, squat, dead, ohp, row, etc) 

&#x200B;

**DIET**

As someone who has tried and failed to lose weight more times than I can count I knew this would be both the hardest part as well as the most important part. For me I KNEW reducing calories works. I've done it before and I have seen the results. But the hardest part for me was sticking with it. That is why I knew that in order to be successful this time around I had to choose a meal routine that is both effective and sustainable. Hence why I kept this part so simple. 

I aimed to intake around 85-90% of my maintain calories, aka a 10-15% deficit. Every Friday I would recalculate my TDEE then subtract 10-15% off the top of it. That would be my daily calorie goal for the week.

After I was down my first 100 pounds I started allowing myself weekly cheat meals on Saturdays. These meals ranged from sushi to Mexican to a few beers lol! 

&#x200B;

**END**

Thanks so much for reading all the way through. I still have so much work left in order to reach my goals but I also know how hard it is to get out there and get started which is why I wanted to make this post. I know what it is like to step back in the gym unable to do the things you once were able to do easily. I know what it is like to be so disgusted with yourself that you don't even want your picture taken. I get it. But I just want to show that despite all that, if you have faith in yourself and you remain consistent that you truly can make a change!!

"Do you need information, or do you need reassurance?",902,yk7ebk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yk7ebk/do_you_need_information_or_do_you_need_reassurance/,50,1667400928.0," 

I want to start by saying very clearly that this is not coming from a place of judgment. It is normal and healthy to need validation and reassurance. Most people have at least a few hangups about how attractive they are, their health, their athletic ability, or some other fitness-related traits. In many cases, your own negative self-perception is reinforced by the people around you, either through outright insults or well-meaning but hurtful comments. It is very much ok to seek out validation that you’re doing the right thing.

I’m putting this question out in the hopes that it helps people do some introspection and ask questions in a way that gets them helpful answers. In both the dailies and in many of the often-deleted self posts this sub gets every day, we get a lot of questions that boil down to some form of the following:

* “Here’s my progress. Is it good enough? Is it normal?”
* “Here’s a body part that I’m struggling to make progress on. Does it look weird?”
* “Here’s how I’m training. Did I fuck it up? Am I going to fail, or injure myself?”

When these questions come up, occasionally the answer is a simple, actionable response. Maybe your progress is slow because you missed some fundamental detail in your initial plan. Maybe that body part isn’t progressing because you aren’t training it enough. Maybe your training plan is a little vague or not right for your goals and needs adjustment.

More often though, people asking these questions seem to be looking for validation. If you’re not sure whether you’re looking for validation or a basic solution to a problem, I’d think through the following questions:

* If I got a clear and direct answer to this question, would it cause me to change what I’m doing in a meaningful way, or would it more change how I *feel* about what I’m doing?
* What is motivating me to ask? Am I asking out of curiosity? Am I asking out of a desire for self-improvement? Am I asking because I’m ashamed of something about my body? Do I consciously know I’m doing the right thing but lack the confidence to internalize that?

I realize this can be messy. If you’re new to fitness, often a question falls into both categories. If you do some reflection and realize that what you’re looking for is largely validation, though, a fitness subreddit may not always be the best place to get it. If this is where you are, I’d suggest trying a few things.

Start with the people close to you. Are you surrounded by people who demean or insult your body, or that you feel pity or condescend to you? Try discussing your struggles with them and see if you can set some boundaries around your body. If you can’t, you may not necessarily need to cut them out of your life, but it may also be time to build some new relationships with people who genuinely like and respect you. This probably sounds a bit glib, because it’s one of the most fundamentally difficult parts of growing up and of adulthood in general, but it’s also some of the most important work you’ll ever do. Working on self esteem is great, but self esteem doesn’t come exclusively from within, and you need people in your life who you can trust to be supportive.

If you have the resources, seek therapy. Again, probably sounds a bit dismissive and glib, but having a strategy for building yourself up emotionally is incredibly helpful, and a therapist who you trust is often the best qualified person to work on that plan with you.

If you’re a little shaky on both information *and* reassurance, and you have the resources, you might want to consider a strength and conditioning coach. You need to be careful in who you select, because the personal training industry can be predatory and feed on reinforcing your anxieties, but a good coach will both teach you how to train and help build your confidence in your ability to do so. For a beginner, a good coach’s job is about 10% providing information and guidance, and 90% reinforcing good habits and building your confidence.

As a final takeaway, just try to remember a few things: You don’t usually have to give up on your fitness goals in order to be kind to yourself and accepting of your current body. Bodies are resilient and adaptable. It’s ok to try something that you’re unsure of and fail. Injuries don’t happen all the time, but they do eventually happen to almost everyone, even people who don’t train at all, and in almost all cases you will recover and adapt.

Anyways, I hope this helps.",2022-11-02 16:55:28

For those unfamiliar, SFAS stands for Special Forces Assessment and Selection. It’s a selection course in the Army that is testing your ability to move quickly and effectively under load (ruck sack), for long distance in degrading physical conditions. There are also tests executed at the beginning to see where your baseline is at, and it is important to crush them.

Essentially, I know I need to train the following:
1). Rucking and running on trails and in the the forest. 
2). Core and back strength out the wazoo
3). Endurance cardio 
4). Body weight exercises such as (but not limited to) push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, rope climbs, and burpees
5). Legs- every aspect of

I have consulted the wise oracle known as Google along with several work out pages with which I’ve used programs on in the past. However, each of them swears that they have the secret to success and that for the small price of 99$ it can be mine. 

What has worked for you in the past? Have you trained for something similar, and if so, what did you use? Do you have any plans you can point me at right off the bat, or plug and play from different things you’ve seen?

I’ve been given several pieces of advice, the first of which is to train for a marathon. The second of which was get in high mileage off of any kind of road. The rest generally play into “be really good at body weight exercise”.

The army does offer a train up program when you are 3 months out from your SFAS date, but I intend to be ready before that point. Any assistance is greatly appreciated, I am unsure of how to intelligently tackle this train up without hurting myself early on.",2022-11-01 00:05:58

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Not happy about progress after ~1 year of lifting,691,yelxfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yelxfb/not_happy_about_progress_after_1_year_of_lifting/,484,1666857499.0,"Hi everyone! 

Like the title says, I feel somewhat lost and would really appreciate any help from you guys. To give some context, I started lifting in mid November, 2021 at the age of 23 (Height - 5'9"", 175cm). Before that, I used to do little to no physical activity, played no sports, used to sit in front of computer for \~10hrs a day. I decided to work on my physique and joined the gym. Here's what I used to look like after a month of joining gym - [https://imgur.com/a/ovCvcuq](https://imgur.com/a/ovCvcuq). Skinny fat, \~70Kg (154lbs).

I had little to no muscle with belly fat, was weak, and so and I decided to bulk for 6 months. I increased my body weight by 10Kg over the period of 6 months, trained hard, did progressive overload (I was following [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), training 6 days a week) and here's what I looked like at the end of June, 2022 - [https://imgur.com/a/52JwTAs](https://imgur.com/a/52JwTAs). 

Starting July 2022, I decided to cut and it's been 4 months and I've cut down to 68Kg (150lbs) and here's what I look right now as of end October, 2022 - [https://imgur.com/a/RkGcmHW](https://imgur.com/a/RkGcmHW)

Since we're done with the context, I'll come back to my point. Looking at my current physique is making me a little disappointed sometimes. I thought I did everything right and optimised everything - I tracked my calories, got enough protein (\~0.8-1g/lb of body weight daily), trained hard, tracked my workouts, implemented progressive overload but now I feel like the end result is not what I thought I would achieve in a year. My goal was to get more muscular, look better but I feel like I look almost the same from where I started, just marginally better. I watched a lot of youtube transformations and saw people achieving significant physique gains in just a year. I'm not saying they became greek god in a year but I can look at their before and after pictures and can appreciate the gains, I'm just not able to do the same for myself which is making me sad. Now I'm not being restless here, I'm willing to give it more time and effort as I have fallen in love with lifting and getting stronger. I just want to know if I'm on the right track or not. 

When I look back at the strength gains, I feel great at what I've achieved. I wasn't able to bench even the bar when I started and now I can bench more than my body weight. Talking about squats and deadlifts, I can squat 1.5x my bodyweight and deadlift 2x my bodyweight. From not being able to do a single pull-up, I can do 10 pull-ups in a row. Following my program, I include both heavy weight, low reps (3-5 reps) and low weight high reps (8-12 reps). It's just that I'm not proud of the muscle gains I have had, if I have gained any.

To summarise, I would like your thoughts on the following questions-

1. How would you rate my before - after pics? (poor/average/good). Am I being too harsh on myself? Am I expecting too much?
2. I'm currently at 68Kg (150lbs), 4 months into my cut and earlier I thought of cutting till I get visible abs. I still don't have visible abs, and some belly fat is still there. What should I do? Should I continue cutting? I'm afraid I'll end up looking more skinny.
3. After ending this cut, I'm planning to go on a lean bulk for the next whole year. Planning to gain \~1Kg/month. Is this fine or should I do it differently?

Any other comments, suggestions are welcomed!",2022-10-27 10:58:19

Hope you have all been well! Its been a year since my last post here and this last year has been a big one for my fitness journey! I finally decided to step out of my comfort zone and commit to a bodybuilding show after 7-8 years of training! I thought I'd do a write up of my experiences with bodybuilding as a whole and the preparation leading up to it as well as what my lifting journey has been like so far!

**WEIGHT:**

Started at 68KG/149lb and bulked up to as high as 88KG/194lb over 5 years of lifting (slow bulk with a few cuts in between). For some reason I don't have any photos of me at 88KG (lol). I then cut down slowly to about 83kg/183lb where I comfortably sit before starting a contest prep in 2021. During this prep I got as low as 75KG/165lb however didn't end up doing a the show because we were in COVID lockdown. Yo-yo dieted after this between 77kg/170lb and 82kg/181lb before starting another contest prep in June 2022 where I got as low as 72.8KG/160lb. 

72.8KG/160lb is a water depleted and carb depleted weigh in so It is a bit skewed but I was around that weight at my leanest. 

Timeframe is approximately 7.5+ years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university. 

**BODYBUILDING:**

As per my previous post, I needed more motivation and was sick of going to the gym and just doing the movements and my body was slowly feeling the aches of lifting heavy for long periods of time. After trying to do the bodybuilding prep in 2021, I enjoyed the training style a lot and the progress I made so I decided I would definitely commit to a show in 2022. I started my 2022 prep in June and finished middle of October. I competed in 2 shows here in the New Zealand IFBB federation (Yes I am aware there are better federations for naturals but over here the NZIFBB is definitely the biggest federation and where most of my friends compete). The first show was a regional show where I placed first in my Mens Physique Novice Class, Second in my open class and Top 4 Overall. The second show is a Natural Nationals show where I placed First in my open class and Top 3 Overall! I am extremely happy with these results especially for my first bodybuilding season and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and have fallen in love with the intricacies of the sport. I didn't know anything about water manipulation, sodium manipulation, carb loading etc before this prep and it was extremely interesting to see the effects of these tools to enhance someone's physique in the short term. 

I do want to mention that getting extremely lean and maintaining is extremely difficult and you do honestly feel really terrible most of the time. Workouts get super crappy and you feel lethargic most of the day. I also had weird aches that prevented me from falling asleep as well as random headaches and dizziness. My partner would also say that I was extremely hangry and would snap at the stupidest things but I think I was okay :). 

**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

These numbers haven't much at all since my last write up as the focus has not been on these movements and instead on bodybuilding and hypertrophy training. I say this because during my competition prep and once I started to get leaner and leaner, I found that these big compound movements were extremely taxing and when I did try to include them, I would feel completely shattered (especially after Squats and Deadlifts) and wouldn't be able to put much into my accessory movements and get the training volume and stimulus that I wanted to train with.  

Please also note that most of these numbers were achieved at a bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 187lb (85kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down.

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 600lb (272.5kg)

**Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 645lb (292.5kg)

**Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 353lb (160kg)

**OHP:** 45lb (20kg) to 243lb (110kg)

**Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 474lb (215kg)

Videos of these lifts can be found on my Instagram.

**PROGRAM**

Training changed quite a lot from what I previous do. I have a wrist injury that I am dealing with at the moment (cyst in the wrist which likely requires surgery) so I removed OHP and Flat Benching from the training. Squats and Deadlifts were also removed about half way into my prep and I realized that previously I had been doing a lot of extra volume that wasn't that necessary (fluff volume). I aimed for two exercises per muscle group per day I was training it usually at 4 sets so a total of 16 total sets per muscle group a week (excluding legs) My split was primarily Push Pull Leg Rest Push Pull Rest. Below is an example workout of the exercises I selected. Just as a note, I wouldn't copy this to a tee because I've adapted this to what I think are my weaknesses etc. 

**Monday - Push 01 Chest Focus**

* 4x8-12 Preacher Curls
* 4x8-12 Incline Bicep Curls

**Sunday - Rest**

It is worthy to note that I was doing cardio (Incline Treadmill Walking) basically 4 weeks into prep. It started off as 20 minutes a day and then progressed slowly and got to one hour per day at the tail end of prep. 

**DIET**

Diet on competition prep was pretty strict, I tracked my macros religiously with almost no days off for months at a time because I had holiday trips planned where I wanted to enjoy myself so I made sure to stay on track the rest of the time to be able to eat whatever when on holiday. My calories ranged from around 3000 calories at the start of prep down to 1800 calories at the lowest point of prep. On average I sat at around 2200-2500 calories for most of the time though. Below is an example of the foods I would eat. 

**Meal 01**

A mixture of Egg whites, Whole eggs, Protein Pancakes, Cereal, Milk, Toast, Peanut Butter, Protein Oats, and Fruit. Most of the time it would be a egg white + one whole egg omelet on toast with ketchup. 

**Meal 02**

150-200g cooked chicken breast

200g Sweet Potato

100g frozen beans or brocolli

**Meal 03**

150-200g cooked Low Fat Beef Mince

150g White Rice

100g frozen beans or brocolli

60-80g protein oats or something carby

**Meal 04 - Pre Gym**

150g Greek yogurt

100g Frozen Blue berries

**Meal 05 - Post Gym**

200g Rump Steak

400g Low Carb Potato or 200g Sweet Potato

100g Frozen Beans or Brocolli

Protein Shake with Water

Usually this adds up to about 2000-2400 calories depending on the day.

Thank you all for reading through this write up and and thank you to those that follow my journey.  I try to answer questions whenever I can but sometimes it is a bit difficult. If you do have any questions though, feel free to ask them on this post (Prefer this over reddit msgs as others can also see the answers this way.)

Advice wanted on Childrens Fitness for Obese child: how do I do this right?,1375,ybink6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ybink6/advice_wanted_on_childrens_fitness_for_obese/,633,1666534120.0,"Advice wanted : 9 year old bordering obese. How to do this right?

My youngest daughter kind of wants to get healthier, we have limited her computer time and are using it a carrot on a stick. She has taken a passing interest in running and boxing. which I'm more than happy to support. I know what works for me as a 39 year old wont work for her and what works for her sisters wont work for her.

I guess my question is as follows.

1) How can I approach this in a way that doesn't make her hate exercise, but appreciate it?

2) How much activity is too much activity for a 9 year old?

I grew up dirt poor. Im talking 1 meal every couple of days so I make sure she eats 3 meals a day and snacks often as she wants. ( i don't get upset if she doesn't clear her plate) I'm concerned about her relationship with food I know I struggle and I don't want that for her. So I'm approaching it with kid gloves and not judging her. I dont want to cut out sweet treats for her but I know north American diets for kids aren't always healthy. (I am not looking for calories deficit recommendations: I was told this my several actual medical professionals to NOT go into caloric deficit, that advice is not good advice in this situation and I know you mean well)

3) How can I approach healthy life style eating at this age without giving her a complex? I eat healthy, and I make healthy meals. good ingredients, proteins, game meat, standard.

4) Are there activities I should avoid, such as MMA or running?

5) what should I absolutely NOT do?

I love this little girl so much, I dont want her to think she isnt good enough as she is, but I do have an obligation to set her up with goals and hobbies and habits that encourage her to live a healthy life. Thank you

*im going to stop here, I have gotten a lot of great advice, some not so good advice and a few hateful trolley DM's all sorts. 

Thanks everyone for your help I really appreciate the perspective.",2022-10-23 17:08:40

No Rest Days,1489,yaw8qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yaw8qa/no_rest_days/,664,1666466628.0,"I have surpassed 1,300 consecutive workouts. That's exercising every day without missing a day for over 3.5 years. Because I have seen such good results, ranging from muscle and strength development to quality-of-life improvements, I suggest you do the same.

While some may argue that such an approach is not optimal, their opinion is founded upon a misconception of recovery. That misconception is that being out of the gym and not doing any physical activity is the best way to recover from a workout. That's not true. If you're exercising three or four hours a week, congratulations, you're barely exceeding the [CDC's recommended minimum.](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm)

The idea that no gym = better recovery needs to die. I am happy to do the killing. Happier still that other people, since I started training without rest days, have started doing the same. Good recovery depends on your work capacity and your habits; sleep, diet, hydration, destressing - those kinds of things. Now, when it comes to work capacity, your training should have some aspect of conditioning. Many new lifters are simply not doing this, which is why I write this post, and put more detail in [this one.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/10/1300-days-process-is-goal.html)

If you have a solid foundation of conditioning, meaning faster pace, higher rep exercises, as well as a decent amount of cardiovascular exercise (like running, hiking, swimming, etc.) then your harder training sessions will be completed more easily and take less out of you. You'll recover better because you are in better shape.

An easy way to get more conditioning in is to... you guessed it... train every day.

Now, I'm not saying you need to go to failure every day. Or that every workout needs to be an hour long and hit every body part oPtImAlLy. All I am saying is that out of the 168 hours each week, you can surely find five to seven hours to get a workout in. By doing so, you can begin the process of incrementally developing your conditioning in such a way that you will gradually begin seeing the benefits of including frequent and demanding conditioning workouts. Perhaps that's lower body fat, or not getting winded going up stairs, or being able to play with your kids longer... who knows.

What I do know, is that more conditioning has improved my strength, physique, and overall fitness. Not only mine, but those who I train, and who follow my training. I am not a special case. You can do what I have done.

**If you are unsure how to get started down the path of no-rest-days, here are some ideas from the above linked blog:**

**1.  Very unfit?** Start with one set of a bodyweight or isolation exercise on your rest days. Complete the work as quickly as possible. Squats, push-ups, sit-ups, curls, etcetera. Do ten reps. If you cannot do ten reps, then do as many as you are able. If that’s five reps, no problem. You must start somewhere. Add a set each week for four weeks, trying to make each ten reps or so. Rest as little as able. Congratulations. You are now doing four sets of ten reps on your former rest days.

On the fifth week, do two exercises, each for one set. Again adding a set to both for four weeks. That would be two months of “no rest days.” Granted, not a whole lot of work on these training days, but at least you are doing something and working towards doing more. The second month ends with two exercises each performed for 4x10. Completed with as little rest between sets as possible.

On the ninth week, the start of the third month, add a third exercise and again repeat the process of adding a set for four weeks. Week twelve ends with three exercises completed for 4x10 for a total of 120 reps (completed as quickly as you can). In these three months you will go from one set on one exercise to four sets on three exercises in a single workout that would otherwise be a day spent lounging around (which is misunderstood as recovery). For each former rest day, do different movements. Develop variety.

For those who are just starting out, this process of gradual development is sustainable and easy to recover from. In fact, doing more will improve your work capacity faster, which means that your recovery ability in general will improve. A small workout when feeling sore is better medicine than a pity party.

**2.  Trained but have a small engine?** Try the above development process, and/or try working against the clock on those days where you’re not weight training. Start with a five-minute workout for as many rounds as possible with two exercises doing ten reps each. Then, on a separate rest day, turn it into a training day by doing five rounds as fast as possible with two different exercises, each for ten reps.

In these two workouts, you have one where you are working with fixed time (the 5-minute AMRAP) and fixed work (five rounds as fast as possible). The variables are volume in the former and time in the latter. This matters because for some one or the other will be more motivating. Additionally, to each you will add more work in a different way every week.

For the fixed time workout, add one minute each week. That turns into eight minutes at the end of the first month. Eight minutes, as fast as possible, of two exercises for ten reps each is tough. Maybe it is just squats and push-ups. Sounds easy? Wrong. Have fun doing it. For the fixed work session, keep those same five rounds but add two reps per exercise. The fourth week is then five rounds of two exercises performed for 16 reps each (Wk1: 10 reps, Wk2: 12 reps, Wk3: 14 reps, Wk4: 16 reps).

For both workouts you will likely find yourself getting more reps done per minute. That is an increase in training density, a function of developing your work capacity. Once you grow bored with this progression, or these exercises, change the movements being performed or change the progression by starting with more time, rounds, or reps per set.

A third option is to have a fixed amount of work, perhaps five sets of ten reps on two exercises (so 100 reps total). Perform them as fast as possible the first week. Then, for the next three weeks, try shaving off time from that same amount of work. This keeps the movement, load, and volume the same but by doing it in less time you are again improving training density. Shaving off one second from the week prior is progress.

These three options are great for those who are already training and for those new lifters who feel up to the challenge. I don’t want it to seem too difficult. These are demanding workout progressions but are easily individualized by working at your own pace and choosing exercises you are already confident with. It doesn’t have to be squats and deadlifts. It could be as simple as push-ups (elevating your hands if needed) and leg lifts, or triceps extensions and biceps curls, or dips and pull-ups. Most people already lifting weights are on a three- or four-day training program, thus, these three options can replace “rest days” and make them productive training sessions.

**3.  Experienced but want to do more and not sure how?** Take any of the options above, scale it up by adding a bit more time, another exercise, or a few more sets, more weight – you get the idea. Just be sensible. Start small and scale your way up the same way a novice would. You would just start with a greater initial demand.

Another option for lifters of this caliber is to do an every minute on the minute (EMOM) workout with a compound lift of your choosing and one or two other accessory exercises. For example: Deadlifts and push-ups. Starting with just ten minutes, add a minute or two each week. Over the course of four weeks this can grow to 16 minutes or more, depending on the development of the lifter.

For EMOM workouts, to make them easier, do fewer reps per set, thereby allowing for more rest before that next minute. To make them harder, do more reps per set, which will have the opposite effect because it will take longer, meaning less rest each minute. Likewise for doing more exercises each round. The more you do every minute, the less rest you get before the next minute starts, and you again must begin repping out the weight.

What I like about EMOM’s for more experienced lifters (meaning those who are confident with their technique; not necessarily having achieved an earthshattering deadlift, for example) is that it allows for more reps to get done with a foundational movement, such as squat, bench, deadlift, etc., while also serving as conditioning. Now, this could be done with the above options, but with EMOM workouts you are afforded a rest period. Something that benefits those major barbell lifts because they can take 10 to 30 seconds to set up for.

An EMOM I recently completed was the trap bar deadlift paired with push-ups. Each performed for five reps, for 60-minutes. That totaled 300 reps, setting me up for success come the 1,300th workout described at the opening of this post. I didn’t start with 60-minute EMOM workouts, but I gradually got myself there. Doing so meant that I stopped being sore after that much work, and, in fact, I could do even more work without demanding too much of my recovery – all because my work capacity has improved so significantly.

Lastly, you can try some of the ideas found [here](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/02/conditioning-barney-style-how-to-stay.html).

**4.  Other Options.** Try adding a session that trains muscles and/or movements that you know are underdeveloped. This would more closely resemble how the T3 accessory exercises are performed in my programs such as [Jacked & Tan 2.0](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html), [UHF](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html), and [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) formatted workouts (or however you currently treat those exercises). Perhaps you are on a body part or an upper lower split. This would allow you to do something like more direct arm work in a new session on that former rest day that comes before your “leg day.” You will then have 24-hours (or more) before your next upper body session, perhaps “chest day.”

Likewise, maybe your current training model has a movement split (rather than body parts; a “bench” day, “squat” day, etc.) or is a full-body session. In such cases you could do all those ab and back exercises you’ve been skipping. More of those is likely what you need to get that next deadlift PR anyways. Just start with a few sets and scale up, much like described above.

Maybe you’re already doing abs, arms, and shoulders as part of your exercise selection and feel it is well rounded. No problem. Do something like farmer’s walks, or other carries, sled drags, or step-ups instead. This is the classic “general physical preparedness” training that was once advocated by guys like Louie Simmons, and many others, but has since been eschewed by the new age hyper-specific optimalists that pollute the information sphere with the tired lies that minimizing your training will maximize your results.

**But is it Optimal?**

Shut. Up.

For most, more training is optimal, not less. If you are dissatisfied with your results, chances are you are not training enough, or eating, sleeping, destressing, and other similar means of actual recovery. So, try doing more of those things that require effort and consistency; things which simply not working out is not. Stressing over online gaming matches while surviving on Soylent and Bangs and sleeping five hours a night is not optimal. Try improving those habits before spending the next three weeks crafting a spreadsheet for the [optimal training program](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-perfect-powerlifting-program.html).

There is no “hack” to an impressive physique or physical ability. Wasting your time scouring the internet for such a one-weird-tricks is not optimal. Strength and conditioning, done frequently and with quality effort, in the traditional means I describe, is.

**Lastly**, if you have time to be on reddit, you have time to workout every day. Start with a single set and ramp your way up as described in the first recommendation.

Full body workouts - Three times a week

Splits -  Two times a week (per muscle group)

This is really confusing to me. Why are people working out each muscle group three times a week when they're doing full body workouts, but only two times when doing splits? (Assuming training intensity is the same for both)

And how often should i do my full body workout routine? Am i leaving gains on the table if i only do it twice a week or am i not recovering well enough when i do it three times? I know that that's also a very individual thing, but i'm asking for general advice for the average person.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all of your responses guys! I'm really not trying to overly optimize anything here, i'm just trying to figure out if i can get away with only two full body workouts a week, or if that would leave too many gains on the table compared to three full body workouts. It would suck to sacrifife more of my sparse time for less/diminishing returns.",2022-10-10 18:13:50

How to incorporate fitness plans for two varying age groups and fitness levels,27,xdpxdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xdpxdn/how_to_incorporate_fitness_plans_for_two_varying/,30,1663122378.0,"My daughter (6) is involved with gymnastics and is relatively fit for her age. I am generally aware of fitness basics at a beginner/intermediate level. I used to train for and race triathlons. I've also done some hypertrophy work in the past. I've been a lurker on this sub for a while and the wiki has always helped guide me.

The thing is, I'm severely out of practice and out of shape. I went through health issues that put a halt to any activity and I let my diet get out of control. My daughter is concerned and asked me to start working out. I asked if she wanted to be my fitness partner and she agreed.

My question is: 

Where do I start with a 6 year old in fitness? How do I figure out what is appropriate that will benefit both of our fitness levels? Should we do walk/runs? Body weight exercises? Yoga? I've re-read the wiki and looked online, but haven't found anything that really gave me a good idea of where to start when it comes to youth fitness.

I've been looking for something that starts slow. She gets discouraged when things start too quickly. I made the mistake of letting her try out for a competitive soccer league without knowing how fast they are out of the gate and she completely lost interest in soccer after that. I don't want that to happen with general fitness.

I'm hoping some of you fitness gurus have any insight for me.",2022-09-14 05:26:18

I know you need low body fat percentage to get your abs to really show. That being said I am a pretty low percentage according to the 3 site test, but even so my abs have very little definition. I started to do weighted Ab training in hopes that they will begin to pop, but now I am simply worried that my stomach and mid section will only end up looking thicker and less desirable. I try doing research on the subject but there is no definite answer. Many advocate for weighted Ab training saying it will make your abs look nicer at higher body fat percentages, while others say it will just push out the fat at higher percentages. I would like to maintain my V figure I am just worried that the weighted Ab training would ruin that for me, and I should stick to body weight like I have been doing.",2022-09-12 09:04:16

Eric has PhD in exercise physiology with a focus on sports nutrition and supplementation, and Greg is a former record-holder in powerlifting who’s lost nearly 60 pounds in the past year since transitioning away from the sport. They have not only released a bundle of 28 free strength training programs to help meet fitness goals, but have also developed a premium nutrition tracking app (MacroFactor) to help really dial in your daily diet! You can find them at https://www.strongerbyscience.com/ and https://www.macrofactorapp.com, where you can browse their free resources, research library, and in-depth nutrition and exercise content to see the science behind building a healthy lifestyle! 

As many folks who have worked on managing their weight already know, gaining control over your diet can be the hardest step: learning how to log calories, wading through information about macros, and successfully implementing new choices/behaviors around food choices can be a real challenge. Stronger by Science is here in r/loseit to talk about their experiences with managing nutrition, and answer your questions about building a healthier lifestyle! So, get your questions ready for Eric and Greg, and prepare to ask them anything! 

NB: This AMA was planned before the recent announcement from MyFitnessPal (about changes to their subscription model). We at r/loseit do not endorse any specific calorie tracking app over another. We are a staff of volunteers who have no financial interest in any specific app or program.

Examine.com Updated Their Website,686,wxjtvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/wxjtvr/examinecom_updated_their_website/,92,1661447699.0,"In case you haven't seen it, [Examine.com](https://examine.com/) launched their new site. For those of that don't know, it's a website that had it's beginnings in this very community about a decade ago because the creators were tired of all the misinformation around nutrition and supplements in the fitness community. Since then they all haven't stopped working and have been expanding more and more, adding new supplements and all the relevant research at what seems like a weekly basis. It's basically a heavily researched/cited Supplements wiki.

They just came out with their new and possibly improved? website design, which is the first update in years. Looks like instead of just focusing on supplements they're also going to be expanding their horizons. Looks pretty cool.

As a healthcare provider I use the website somewhat regularly because my patients always have questions and while I try to be well read, it's impossible to keep up with everything by yourself. So I do a dive, and tell them what stuff their sketchy naturopath prescribed them is actually just a huge waste of money/cash grab, and what actually might help. I always of course always stress that healthy eating habits, exercise, adequate sleep, and reducing causes for stress are always the four pillars, but on top of that supplements can help for stuff, particularly in certain situations (living far enough north of the equator/working indoors during the day and Vitamin D supplementing, if you can't get enough protein from regular food, supplementing, if you can't get enough fiber from food, supplement, and so on). 

Linking directly to the actual studies has always been the biggest thing for me, because sometimes you want to just do the deep dive lit review. But I like the increasing information on the website as well for the times when I'm feeling lazy. I like how it looks quite a bit more streamlined/things are more integrated.

Not feeling the purple colour, but maybe it'll grow on me, I am still partial to the old blue, heh.",2022-08-25 20:14:59

Going on a road trip in the United States and looking for some tips on how to still hit the gym (weightlifting only). I will be stopping at a different location every day.

Do I exclusively search for hotels that have an onsite gym? Most hotels I've been to in America have crummy cardio focused ""fitness centers"" with dumbbells that go up to only 50lb. Should I purchase a multi-city gym membership at a chain gym for a month? Do I just exploit free trials and day passes at local gyms?

"What is a good daily fitness habit that you can't start as a beginner, but should build up to?",769,ww0syr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ww0syr/what_is_a_good_daily_fitness_habit_that_you_cant/,412,1661290505.0,"Context: I'm close to finishing the good ol' C25K, doing casual calisthenics on rest days (planning on going serious later), doing sun salutations after waking up, and about to finish reading Spark, which has led me to this doubt. The book talks about the great mental health benefits of aerobic exercise and recommends building up to a daily active routine. I've fallen in love with running and would do so every morning if I built it up to the point a 30-minute jog is as casual as going out for a walk.

This got me to wonder, what are other things you could build up to that may start as actual workouts but could benefit you as a habit? I was thinking of experimenting with a daily failure set of push ups, squats, calf raises, band pull-aparts and/or some ab work and see where that ends up; the goal here is not a proper workout, but rather physical activity that keeps the machine running, I suppose, without taxing my recovery.

DEXA scans and other inaccuracies,505,wv0a5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/wv0a5h/dexa_scans_and_other_inaccuracies/,101,1661190621.0,"Really good article from u/gnuckols today on body composition ""measurements,"" including DEXA. This is a subject that comes up here from time to time, so...

Here's the article: [https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/](https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/)

Some relevant quotes:

>The first thing to know is that there’s no way of *measuring* body composition in living, breathing humans. There is exactly one way to *measure* body composition: carefully dissecting a cadaver, and weighing each component of the cadaver after completing the dissection. That’s certainly a morbid fact to ponder, but it’s the bedrock of body composition assessment.  
>  
>If you’ve never been dissected – since you’re reading this article, I assume you haven’t – you’ve never had your body composition *measured*. You’ve only had your body composition *estimated*. Understanding this fact is important for two reasons. First, it invites a simple question: “what IS actually being measured in order to estimate body composition?” Second, it invites us to consider the validity and reliability of body composition estimates.

I was already familiar with the pitfalls of BIA scales (and other devices that use conductive pads on your hands or feet to estimate body fat %) but I never got a DEXA scan or even gave DEXA much thought, so I only had a vague sense that there is some inaccuracy but wasn't sure where it might come from. This was eye opening (emphasis mine):

>Due to the relatively expensive and high-tech nature of these scanners, people often assume that their body composition estimates are nearly perfect. However, there are some noteworthy limitations that are rarely acknowledged outside of academic journals. For example, DEXA scanners are unable to directly measure tissue thickness, so **they are forced to derive composition estimates of a 3-dimensional body from a 2-dimensional scan**. Further, the devices are only able to estimate soft tissue composition (i.e., the relative content of lean tissue and fat tissue) in pixels that contain no bone mass. For most scans, about 40% of the total pixels will contain bone, so **nearly half of the scan is essentially uninterpretable** (without assumption-driven calculations) for the purpose of body fat estimation.

We often assume that even if a method is a little bit off, it will still be consistent enough to help us measure changes over time. That's not always true, though. When it comes to BIA scales, I noticed that my scale never changes its estimate very much even when I've made significant changes to my body composition. Research bears this out; scales aren't very useful this way.

Here's how that may shake out with DEXA (this quote comes after a detailed example, worth clicking through and reading the whole thing):

>If DEXA says you lost 14kg of fat and 6kg of lean mass, that actually means you lost somewhere between 10-18kg of fat, and somewhere between 2-10kg of lean mass. In other words, DEXA is telling you that the outcome of your diet was somewhere between “unambiguously good” and “catastrophically bad.”

This doesn't mean scans are useless, but we should probably be taking them with a huge grain of salt - which may make some of us reconsider whether we want or need one.",2022-08-22 20:50:21

I also tried split squats at a 6 in elevation just body weight and I just can’t seem to get myself back up, same with any variation of lunges.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Improving athletic ability,21,wm0qnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/wm0qnx/improving_athletic_ability/,24,1660248108.0,"Hello all. I’m not sure to which community to ask this question to but this one looked relevant to me.

I’m a 31 year old guy and growing up I never took up any sports or athletics. 

I started playing table tennis when I was around 22 and I’m quite decent in it. I have taken up badminton as well recently and I’m okay in that too. I’m very poor in football but I have the stamina to run around for an hour of football(astro turf 7vs7). I can jog for 40 mins and my best is 5K in 28 mins.

Here is my problem, in table tennis, badminton, football or any sport I cannot generate the power I see others doing. They are quite bad at the sport and I can beat them(in table tennis and badminton) but the power they generate on some of the shots I can only dream of. I’m hitting with all my might but I can never get that acceleration and power. Even in football I cannot generate the power to kick the ball far. Guys who are thinner and weaker than me are generating that power effortlessly. 

I have taken up gym as well recently to improve my power and I have never been to gym ever in my life. But still I’m no good. What is it that I lack in general? What type of exercise should I take up to improve on this? 

What I have noticed is that i can generate the acceleration these other guys seems to produce. In all the above sports I read constantly that I should not tense up the body but no matter how loose I hold rackets or keep my legs loose I can never generate that power.

How do I train for that? Any ideas. Sorry for the long post.",2022-08-11 23:01:48

However, depression and anxiety disorders and other medical issues have resulted in me feeling so fatigued all the time that I gave up on high intensity exercise. The medical issues are gone now but the depression/anxiety is still there and I still feel fatigued.

Do you have experience of working through such situations? Have you trained anyone with such problems? I just want to know what type of stuff could be a safe way for me to test how much my body can handle.

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have.

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

_________Example of What's in the Notes_________

**Quick Intro:**

These are 6 months worth of reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and trying new methods of training all in my pursuit to be more fit.  That said, I've decided to share notes I've taken on the three coaches I consider to be the top teachers and doers of the strength, conditioning, and nutrition industry, whose pedigree spread across the experienced  trenches of Olympians, US Special Operations, World Strongest Man, UFC, NFL, etc --just to name a few. Now, they are by no means the holders of the gospel of fitness, nor are they the only voices worth listening to, but here's why I chose who I chose:

**Philosophy of Choice:**

* Achievements in personal fitness - need to be fit, and have fitness results in their own life. Can't be all head knowledge or studies. No book worms or science nerds without the in-the-trenches experience.
* Achievements in client fitness - need to have produced results in others lives, because knowing what works for you is vastly different than being able to identify, correct, and advance what works for others.
* Renown and respected by the community - peers need to recognize contributions to the community
* Longevity - How long have they been in the game? How long have they stayed healthy? How long have they been training clients? All important questions in establishing reputation.


**Why I Chose Stan Efferding:**

> To me, Stan is the summation of an average guy with absolute discipline who's taken the best advice from the best gurushe's personally trained with from around the world for decades, and becoming himself an absolute beast. I chose Stan because of his humble demeanor, and because he's also one of the strongest bodybuilders in the world. Additionally, he has trained the Mountain to win his first Arnolds Strongest Man 2018 this past March.

>* Blue collar guy who presents some info. No tips or tricks. Turned over every rock looking for the secret. Spent loads of money, and there is only one answer: sleep, eat, and train.
* Matt Wenning calls him ""the strongest bodybuilder on planet earth.""
* Helped get Hapthorr ""The Mountain"" diet in check, where he set records in elephant bar (1000lbs+) and bag-over-bar, and take first as Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coached various bikini competitors, NBA, NFL, MLB, UFC, etc
* Worked with Brian Shaw's diet and helped him achieve second place at Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coaching Larry Wheels (aesthetic and powerful beast) and Dan Green. 
* Has trained with almost every guru in the business, directly or indirectly.
* Former bodybuilding and powerlifting competitor. 
* Squats in the 800lbs+ at 50+ years of age.


**Why I Chose Charles Poliquin:**

> One of the first world renown and truly experienced strength coaches of the modern era. ""Research catches up to Charles,"" has been said about his bleeding edge yet common sense approach to training. While considered by a few to be the king of psuedo-science, the ironic part of this claim is that from all my note-taking from the past 6 months --from books on Green Berets to interviews with the Mountain to 3-hour long seminars with various teachers-- Charles cites his sources and explains the history of what he's talking about more often than any other individual or source I've been reading, watching, or listening.

> * One of the best and most distinguished strength coaches in the world.
* Trained various Special Operations (Seal Team 6, SAS included)
* Coached the US womens team to win their first Olympic gold in history, and defeated Japan in their 20 year reign.
* 38+ years of Olympian training across 23 different sports, went to 3 different Olympics as a coach. Also have trained various high-level professional athletes and coaches in the military, Crossfit, NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.
* Researches studies from as far back as 1890's
* Ability to recall information, facts, research papers, all to the date, location of study, and to the author/researcher, a skill second to no other fitness expert (reminds me of the level of expert recall Robert McNaramara displays in the documentary ""Fog of War"").
* Lectures around the world with book authors like Jay Papasanas, Ed Coan, and world renown athletes like Dmitry Klokov.
* Always ahead of the curve (attributed as first in the US to recommend BCAAs, fish oils, German Volume training,  tempo training, cluster training, neuro transmitter profile training, etc).
* Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Mark Bell have all implemented information from Charles into their personal training, and how they train clients, and all speak highly of him.
* Has huge biceps and abs for an old man.

**Why I Chose Matt Wenning:**

> I chose Matt because of his personal and professional achievements. Hired to train various Special Operations for the military and is the first to be implemented at a large scale. His methods have reduced injury rates across the board for fire, police, and military (and thus saved money for those organizations), and is a master of training and preventing overtraining.

> * Multiple records in the squat alone, including a 1196lb squat.
* Broke 4 world records; second highest RAW at 208 class with 2204lb total.
* Works with thousands of US military, including various Ranger regiments, 4th Infantry, and paratroopers out of Bragg. 
* Developed Mountain Warrior Athlete program out of Ft. Carson.
* Clients include NFL, US Special Operations, law enforcement, fireman, professional athletes, universities, elderly (difficult to train and yield safe results) and kids with disabilities
* His training with first responders and military has reduced site budgets significantly, due to decreased injuries and insurance claims.
* Attended university in Indiana where NASA funded the strength and conditioning programs and recruited top-tier professors.
* Top ten in the world for almost two decades with no major injuries (rare in the strength industry)
* Masters degree in sports biomechanics under Dr. Kramer
* Trained closely and mentored by various powerlifting legends like Louie Simmons, Ed Coan from his teen years, and was one of the youngest to squat 900lbs

**Notes on Notetaking:**

> Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again.

> **Compilation of Notes Regarding Training Women:** (work in progress)

> * For the female lifter: 10-minute walks better than 40 minute treadmill. Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. 
* If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak.
* 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. 
* Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it.
* Stan noticed how joggers carry fat.  Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide.
* Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development.
* ""How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?"" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men.
* How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. ""Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.""
* When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out.
* ""Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue."" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc)
* Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body.
* 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. 
* Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night.
* Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle.
* ""*There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that*""
* States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive.
* Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. 
* Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity.
* **Common mistakes with trainers and female clients:** not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity.
* Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive 
* Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). 



**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**

There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.

1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. 
3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
5. **Warm-Up:** Static stretching isn't the best option prior to a lift, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. 
6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.",2022-07-26 19:10:07

Nuckols: What is the optimal dose of resistance training for longevity?,529,w3s6ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/w3s6ap/nuckols_what_is_the_optimal_dose_of_resistance/,264,1658338057.0,"[Full article here.](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/research-spotlight-lifting-longevity/)

Summary:

> Overall, this meta-analysis offers a perspective that may be really helpful for a variety of people in a variety of circumstances. For example, if a friend, family member, or potential client is interested in getting into resistance training, they may be concerned that they’ll need to live in the gym to reap notable benefits. However, you can tell them that they’ll likely reap most of the health benefits with just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week, thus massively reducing the perceived barrier to starting. Similarly, plenty of serious lifters find it hard to keep up their desired training schedule due to changes in life circumstances (for example, starting a new job with punishing hours, or having kids). They may want to keep lifting for health reasons, but they aren’t sure if cutting their weekly training time from 4 hours to 1 hour will result in a resistance training dose that’s even worthwhile. Again, this meta-analysis suggests that just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week is associated with a host of positive health and longevity outcomes, meaning that a considerable reduction in training volume will still result in a worthwhile and meaningful dose of training.

> Conversely, I suspect that most readers probably engage in resistance training for more than 130-140 minutes per week. This meta-analysis suggests that such a training dose may actually be associated with higher all-cause mortality risk, cardiovascular disease risk, and total cancer risk. So, how concerned should you be?

> I’d like to be able to say that you don’t need to be concerned at all (that would certainly fit my biases), but this isn’t the first time that such a relationship has been observed. 

Before we all panic and step away from our longer or more involved programs, some caveats:

> However, it’s also worth mentioning that the studies included in the present meta-analysis were all observational in nature. In other words, they tell us the relationships between resistance training dose and mortality/disease risk, but they can’t tell us that the resistance training dose causes the observed reductions and elevations in risk. 

> With all of that said, there’s one major reason to be skeptical that these results will generalize to all readers: the studies in this meta-analysis mostly used older subjects. It’s entirely possible that the optimal dose of resistance training for older adults is a lot lower than the optimal dose of resistance training for younger adults. For example, oxidative stress and generalized inflammation likely contribute to biological aging, and older adults have higher levels of oxidative stress and generalized inflammation. 

TL:DR- 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week can have major health/longevity benefits.",2022-07-20 20:27:37

I've been advised to not lift heavy weights (like ever) and not do contact sports for practically the rest of my life.  


As someone who is quite passionate about the gym, is it possible for me to maintain my fitness goals of getting the gym shape without lifting weights? I understand that cardio and such can help me get lean, but I'd want to have fairly defined arms, shoulders etc as I was working towards before my incident. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

Edit: Thanks for the replies! I should add though that calisthenics are probably a big no no due to the internal pressure it creates. and i can't really strain or do anything with my head below my torso :/

I will definitely listen to ophthalmologists first and foremost, I was just hoping to hear some experiences from others in similar situations. Additionally, I was never aiming to be buff or ""big"". I'm going from overweight to lean so I know cardio will play a big part regardless of my situation, but I'm just looking for ways to still have the upside down triangle shape and maintain my traps, arms etc",2022-07-19 22:05:56

Is there an objective standard of physical prowess that everyone should aim to?,456,w25itf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/w25itf/is_there_an_objective_standard_of_physical/,546,1658166517.0,"I heard Peter Attia say that in his clinic, a 50 year old patient is asked to stay at the level equivalent to his own 40 year old at peak performance.

I believe they do mainly strength training (weight lifting), ""cardio"" (what he calls zone 2), and something resembling HIIT.

What left me wondering is: what is this ""peak performance"" he mentions? And what does it mean for me? As a 37 y.o., what physical feats should I be able to perform, even if I'm not an athlete? What are the things that everybody should be able to perform in some measure, and is there some kind of standard?

If somebody asked you: ""what physical things everybody should aim to be able to perform for as long as they live?"" (doesn't mean they can now, or at 70 or at 90, but that they should aim to)

So even if there is no consensus whatsoever, it would be interesting to simply know what is your answer to this

I'll write some completely random examples to give you an idea:

\- Deadlift your own body weight 3 sets 5 reps

\- Able to full squat (until your but touches the floor)

\- Run 5 km in 30 minutes

\- Bike 100 km within one day

\- Climbing a 5 meter tall tree

\- Walk from sunrise to sunset

\- Horse stance 15 minutes

\- Dive 20 meters deep

If you want to say, ""it depends on your goals"". Then assume the goal would be to maintain a great physical health through one's entire life, including very old age.

Edit: Lol, didn't expect so many comments. The examples above are completely random and non-sensical. I didn't try to think of a ""standard"" myself.",2022-07-18 20:48:37

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

How to convince myself to not overreach/overtrain?,344,vtlg8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/vtlg8r/how_to_convince_myself_to_not_overreachovertrain/,111,1657208183.0,"Hi All,

I don’t post much if ever but I’ve recently had an issue where, even though I do workout a lot, I’ve started feeling myself actually getting weaker.

I box as my main sport, at the very amateur level, and I had a pretty gnarly concussion in Feb that took me out. Before then I was in the best shape of my life, working out sometimes twice a day (strength in morning, boxing in evenings), doing proper recovery, and feeling great. I took nearly a month off after the concussion since I could barely walk the first two weeks. I was almost at the point where I feel like I’m near the same shape as before.

The issue is, especially in my legs, my body seems to tire and fatigue during intense workouts way easier than I remember - to the point where last week my coach noticed and questioned me on it. 

I’m thinking I need to potentially take more recovery and slow down, but honestly I hate doing that. I like exercising hard, pushing myself, and I feel like shit when I don’t. To others that had a similar situation where they need to lay off the gas - what did y’all do to convince yourself it was ok? 

TL;DR : How do you work out less to emphasize recovery without feeling lazy?",2022-07-07 18:36:23

"Main Lift Tracker, Accessory Progression, and 5/3/1 FSL + nSuns Plate Calculator Spreadsheets",52,vqun5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/vqun5p/main_lift_tracker_accessory_progression_and_531/,13,1656893382.0,"I have created several spreadsheets that could hopefully be of some use to whoever wants them. Do not request access. Make your own copy.

**Main Lift Progress Tracker for programs that use a daily AMRAP set (such as most 5/3/1 templates)**

1: Input the monday of the week you start in the blue date cell. By default it is the nearest monday to today, which is 7/4/2022

2: Input your daily weights and reps for the week on the left block in the blue cells.

You can change what the main lifts are, just do so on the top of the left block, and the rest will fix.

The middle block displays the exact estimated 1rm for each lift *no matter which version you use*, next to it will be the total of your S/B/D (the OHP is included on the individual lift graph, NOT the big 3 total), with the difference between each week next to that, then the right side will graph your lifts depending on the spreadsheet. The maximum Y value will change according to your lifts. Your big 3 totals will not appear until every main lift for the week is filled and the difference between weeks will not appear until you have the weeks logged. It was done this way so the graphs don't just read a 0 for information that has not yet been logged.

There are 2 different versions that graph the lifts a bit differently. These should both be accessible now, let me know if they aren't!

[True Main Lift Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QYKjgNxZqONf0ar9_wvrVO8m9hNds8iiEs9icMKi7c/edit#gid=1219405196) Graphs your 1rm estimates.

[Max Main Lift Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEvQDsu4qbzKFFX2X9xva4AYAIKkNSmLl3KxDyDOxZg/edit?usp=sharing) Graphs your best lift to date. If your bench numbers go from (200,190,210), it will ignore the dip and instead graph (200,200,210). Your Big 3 total and graph will also be your maxes to date. I like this one because the dips are upsetting, and I know I didn't truly lose that strength, I just had a less than perfect day. (it also makes the trendline look nicer ;))

&#x200B;

Not the main point of the post, or really anything special, but I have them so I figured I would share these:

**SBS Accessory Progression**

This is an automated accessory progression based on a post by Greg Nuckols I made for use in the SBS templates. I had this in my SBS Hypertrophy sheet but pasted it into a new sheet to share, because the SBS programs are paid and I of course can't share those, so this will look pretty bare bones.

Your goal is to perform a total of 40 reps in 3 sets. If you succeed, you then do 50 in 4 sets with the same weight. Then the weight bumps up an increment and you begin again at 40 reps in 3 sets. If you fail any day, it will not progress, and the weights, reps, and sets will stay the same until you beat it. This is why all of the weights, reps, and sets will look the same for each week before you start progressing.

Fill in the blue cells with the name, smallest increment, and starting weight of the lift. To progress, fill in the total amount of reps completed in the blue cells each week. Google sheets is creating some odd borders when you paste it, so you could just highlight the 4 rows afterwards and select ""Borders > Clear Borders"" on the top of the screen.

[SBS Accessory Progression](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWTL0ND7DoPqhhLkGKYmna5dSv2msEcXDWScvjSFzAI/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**5/3/1 and nSuns 5 day LP With Plate Calculators**

Fill in your barbell weight and plates from heaviest (left) to lightest (right). Not every plate cell has to be filled. If your plates do not add up evenly to the weight of a set, the calculator for that set will display ""Plates Do Not Add Up!"". The 5/3/1 template will have a dropdown for different supplemental options (FSL, SSL, and BBB (3 popular ones that are not paid))

[5/3/1 Plate Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v41UN7iXwrua2noqjbzcuaftdtypXY77KFIn2viKe-4/edit?usp=sharing)

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Anyone know of studies into how much fitness is gained from full days of exercise (rather than shorter sessions)? E.g. cycle touring,103,vjjtfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/vjjtfc/anyone_know_of_studies_into_how_much_fitness_is/,32,1656060393.0,"Hey folks.

&#x200B;

I'm a lapsed cyclist trying to get back into training in time for an upcoming triathlon. What I really enjoy, far more than 'training for the sake of training' is going for long multi-day cycle tours, often carrying a tent and wild camping. As a student, 5+ day trips of 80-100 mile days with 20+kgs of equipment on the back up the hills of Scotland & northern England lead to some of the best fitness of my life. So it leads me to wonder.  


All the news articles and research papers I've ever read about training and exercise talk about short, daily / etc sessions. But **is there research into the effects of longer-form exercise?**

Opinions and experiences also welcomed! 🙂",2022-06-24 11:46:33

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Specific Training for SCBA Use?,188,vc2ztm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/vc2ztm/specific_training_for_scba_use/,82,1655211675.0,"High level - Volunteer firefighter, looking for advice on how to train my breathing for better use of SCBA (Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, basically limited air). 

Last night we had a training where we had to be on air. The cylinders are rated for 30-minutes under normal breathing. I used nearly the entire cylinder in close to 10 minutes. People who appear to be in worse shape (significantly heavier) last longer on a cylinder than I do. 

I have been training quite a bit lately, both weight training and cardio. I've tried doing some higher volume squats 225+ of 3x12, and I'm able to run okay (10k under 56 minutes).  

I figured my improved fitness would help me with my breathing on an SCBA, but it seems like I drain the air even faster than before. I'm assuming this is from training with ""free"" air, so I've become accustomed to breathing strongly. 

Not sure if anyone would have any programs or advice on how to improve my breathing while using an SCBA",2022-06-14 16:01:15

# 2. Background

I can’t say how/when I got my first pull-up. I’ve always been able to do 1 or 2 (*albeit poorly executed*) since I was a child in PE class.

# 3. Timeline

### ***May 2019 - May 2020 (1 Year) / 1 to 5 Reps:***

Gym hosted a [Murph Challenge](https://themurphchallenge.com/pages/the-workout) & I had to sub in lat-pulldowns for pull-ups after 5 poor reps. This was when I decided to try & improve. I worked out 4x a week in a group strength training class & began adding pull-ups at the end of each class. As you might expect, attempting pull-ups after a strenuous strength class 4x a week didn't lead to great gains. After a year, I could only do 5-7 slightly better reps.

### ***Jun 2020 - Nov 2020 (6 months) / 5 to 11 Reps:***

Gym reopened after being closed for the first half of the year (*COVID)* & I decided to get right back to it. I started doing 3 sets of pull-ups, at the start, middle & end of my workouts (*solo strength training + FIT45 classes 5-6x a week*). I didn't set a fixed rep goal but would go until just shy of failure for each set.

By Oct 2020, I was consistently hitting 8-9 reps but was struggling to get 10 reps. I sought advice from r/bodyweightfitness & weighted pull-ups were recommended. That did it! On Nov 6, 2020, I got my first 10 rep set. I spent the rest of the year cleaning up my form & ended with 11 reps on Dec 31, 2020.

### ***Jan 2021 - Oct 2021 (9 months) / 10 to 15 Reps:***

My initial pull-up goal had been to hit 10 reps  & I didn’t have any strong motivation to do more. I felt fine sticking with 10 reps. By end of summer 2021, I realised 10 reps weren't providing a stimulus anymore. I could do them no matter the conditions (*hungry, sore, tired etc.*). At this point, I was familiar enough with the concept of progressive overload & decided it was time to increase reps, volume & weights for all sets. On Oct 15, 2021, I got my first 15 rep set. I was very proud of it & made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/q8mf7y/bw_pullup_milestone_15_reps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Fitness30plus. At this point I knew I wanted to keep going until I could get a 20 rep set.

### ***Oct 2021 - Jun 2022 (8 Months) / 15 to 20 Reps:***

I chose to stick with the same principles of increasing reps, volume & weights to hit 20 reps. On Jan 4, 2022, I got 16 reps. Again, I felt quite proud & [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/rvtdqu/pullup_pr_16_reps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Gym about it. On Jan 6, 2022, I got 17 reps. I didn't make a post but [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rzofqs/comment/hrwkgld/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on the Fitness Victory Sunday thread. On Jan 9, 2022, I tested positive for COVID. My illness was mild. I rested & isolated for 10 days & got back in the gym on Jan 19.

Mild or not, it did me in cardio-wise. My strength came back quickly but I struggled to catch my breath. My chest-strap heart rate monitor would show my HR spiking up & down erratically. I like to play this game with my HRM ([*my tile displays on a TV*](https://www.myzone.org/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Tiles-1.jpg?width=700&height=500&name=Tiles-1.jpg)) where I move as much as possible to stay in the yellow zone (*80-89% of maximal heart rate*) but I put a stop to that & focused on not over-exerting myself. I dialed down the reps, volume & weights for everything & intentionally didn't ramp up until April 2022.

On May 7, 2022, I got 19 reps. I didn't make a post, but I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ukxqgs/comment/i7s5yf4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) again on the Fitness Victory Sunday thread. On June 13, 2022, I got 20 reps on my 2nd set as I failed my 1st set.

# 4. Training

I brute-forced my training & while it eventually paid off, I should have trained smarter. I don’t recommend this & suggest following a program. [The Fighter Pull-up Program](https://www.strongfirst.com/the-fighter-pullup-program-revisited/) is highly recommended.

That said, if you'd like to be a mad person & wing it, the core tenets of my ramshackle training are; (1) Don't go to failure on working sets, (2) Pump up the volume, (3) Add weight & (4) Mind your form.

There are many resources for pull-ups, but I especially like this video, [The Perfect Pull Up by Calisthenic Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGo4IYlbE5g)  & this brilliant post, [The Elusive Pull-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/lrgeht/the_elusive_pullup/) by u/stephnelbow.

I used a rack at the gym 98% of the time. I used a pull-up bar at home & playground bars for the other 2%. I used gloves initially (*I dislike calluses immensely*) but with time my grip strength improved to the point I didn’t need them. I also bought a [Harbinger Dip Belt](https://www.amazon.com/Harbinger-Polypropylene-Steel-Chain-Black/dp/B001P0S3XU?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) once I started adding weights.

I didn't train only pull-ups these 3yrs. From Jun 2020 to Dec 2021, I ran a GZCLP program, attended FIT45 classes 3x a week, did LISS cardio & completed a 1yr bulk. In Jan 2022,  I switched to the 5/3/1 BBB program, I'm continuing FIT45 classes, LISS cardio & trying to eat at a slight surplus daily.

# 5. Miscellaneous

Yes. I know. Legs straight down & pointed. Trust me, I know. I can do them that way, but I don't like it. Legs crossed is easier for me. Please let me live purists :)

I'm going to stick with 20 reps until it becomes ""easy"". I remember when 10 reps became easy & I hope to get there with 20 reps.  I'd also like to learn how to do a muscle-up or two.

Finally, a shoutout to u/SelfiesSuck. Almost a year ago he made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lgv746/finally_hit_my_goal_of_getting_20_pullups_in_one/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) & I was so impressed. I saved that post & came back to it many times for inspiration. Thank you.

How to build a routine for aggressive skating or a specific athletic/sport goal,251,v76jlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/v76jlr/how_to_build_a_routine_for_aggressive_skating_or/,63,1654633308.0,"Hi all, this one's a bit longer so TLDR; I'm looking for how to build a routine that helps support a specific sport (my sport is aggressive inline) that includes strength, stability, power, and conditioning while still leaving time to actually do the sport. 

I've looked through the wiki and done some research but I'm kind of stuck. I used to be quite fit in general but dropped off for a couple years. Got back into it and have been doing mostly conditioning for the past week. My goals are to get back into aggressive inline skating but supplement with workouts to help improve my strength, cardio, and stability/balance (essentially overall athleticism). The program I'm following so far (with some variations like Australian pull-ups instead of pull-ups) is [this one](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/routine/workouts/workout-routines/ultimate-workout-program-be-all-around-athlete/) but it's almost entirely conditioning and I feel I'm not really going to gain much in terms of strength since I'm not doing anything with heavy weights (deadlifts, barbell squats, etc). 

Looking around at other routines it looks like heavy weight days and conditioning days are mixed in, like [this one](https://betterme.world/articles/athlete-workout-plan-how-to-train-like-a-pro/) which literally uses the same conditioning and power production days as the one I'm following but combines them together to add in an Upper/Lower weighted split. 

What I'm confused about:

1) With a 5 day regimen like this, when am I supposed to actually go out and do my sport? On my rest days? On the same day as I'm doing training? 

2) Is combining conditioning with heavier weights the way to go? How can get a good balance?

I've also considered doing something like a 3-day PPL split plus one day power production and one day conditioning with aggressive skate training fit somewhere in there at least twice a week and yoga 1-2 times a week to focus on stability. Does this sound good, and how should I schedule these workouts? 

I'm just generally lost how to work out for a specific athletic goal instead of for pure strength, cardio, or vanity muscles, since I've never had to do so before.",2022-06-07 23:21:48

"Best Boxing workout programs and Best ""smart"" Boxing equipment?",337,v6cp0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/v6cp0v/best_boxing_workout_programs_and_best_smart/,82,1654546994.0,"Hi r/fitness!  

I have recently gotten very interested in obtaining some boxing equipment for my home gym to implement some extra cardio into my regimen. I am not looking to be a professional, just want something fun to add to my cardio game.  

I have been looking at some different smart technology boxing equipment:  

1. DribbleUp: These are smart gloves that would track progress, comes with some type of app with workouts. I would need my own bag. Smart Gloves: $75; Bag: ??; Continued membership to the app $14/mo 
2. QuietPunch: Small punching bag which attaches to a doorframe that has a smart sensor in itself to track progress, comes with gloves and has some type of app that has workouts. Smart Bag plus gloves: $239; Lifetime membership to the app included
3. FightCamp: Full size stand up professional looking kick and punching bag, gloves, smart trackers. $999; Membership to the app $39/mo  

So as you can see these are all kinda pricey. I really like the idea of tracking my progress which is why I am considering the ""smart"" equipment in the first place.  

My question is, what is everyones opinion on what would be the best choice?  

Should I just get my own bag, maybe the smart gloves, and look for workout videos online?  

Related question: Does anyone here currently have a membership to an online boxing workout platform (an app, trainer, or gym you follow for workouts) paid, or free?

Thank you in advance for your help in narrowing this down for me.",2022-06-06 23:23:14

Recently took some medical board exams and lost my mojo (mind gets locked into study mode). I was really consistent with the gym prior for several months, better than ever actually, but I feel like my diet is always the same.

I find myself snacking/eating shit food on weekends (only at nights) especially mixed with alcohol. I love relaxing and taking a weekend night to enjoy myself, but I fear that eating ""junk"" food has become an activity to me mentally. If I want to get lean, what are some ways I can approach this behavior? I don't want to avoid alcohol and junk food entirely, but I feel like my current habits are always limiting my progress. I know having a leaner body would make me feel happy, but I debate whether that happiness is surface level based on societal standards. ",2022-05-26 20:44:01

I work a busy desk job and still being a dad (2 kids, one disabled) I don't have lots of time for the gym. 


I've looked online but I can't see much info around lifting plans for carers. I was hoping that some combination of fireman/army/drunk friend workout tips might help me plan a routine. 


One thing to note, I'm looking to keep injury to a minimum. Tweaking my back for a month will be more than a minor inconvenience putting on socks. 


Some background about my fitness. About 10 years ago I read starting strength and have reasonable form for my compound lifts. I've not been a gym regular for a few years because of being a dad and work. My max lifts were no record breakers because I was very active playing sports year round. 


Also, I'm likely to play some tennis and cycle. I have a gym membership through my sports club (it's a good gym with squat rack etc) and have kettle bells at home and a yoga mat.

What I am wondering is: whne can I consider I ""master"" one exercise in the progression?

Some exercises have reps. Being able to do 1 set of 10 reps seems reasonable to me to say ""I can do this"".

Some exercise are about ""holding"", like the plank. 60 seconds seems like a resonable amount of time, but maybe it's too much (Maybe 45 seconds?).

I'm pulling those out of my \*\*\* though.

Or maybe it's more complicated, and it depends on the exercise? (after all, not all muscles have the same size and capabilities)

Is there any generally agreed definition of mastering an exercise, in this sense? What is it? If there isn't, what's your opinion? When should I check one exercise as mastered, and move on to the next exercise in the progression?

I'd appreciate advice

Edit: the reponses tend to focus in the ""Mastering"" vs ""Good enough"" of the question. If I could word my question better, it would be: ""In a bodyweight progression, how many reps / hold time do I need to be able to do to move on the next exercise"".

The concise answer by u/surferguy999 seems reasonable:

\- 3x5 to 3x8 reps

\- 15 seconds to 30 seconds for ""hold""",2022-05-20 18:52:35

It might be a bit self-indulgent but I hope there is still something of value for others in my looking at how my training and thoughts have evolved over three years and 100lbs of deadlift. 

Having learned my lesson last time, I include [this still]( https://imgur.com/a/fNzpTnp) of my pull as the first linked image so the thumbnail does not auto-populate with the picture of my first deadlift ever. Hopefully this will avoid numerous comments from people who do not read anything besides the title but still feel the need to hear themselves talk. 

**Deadlift Timeline**:

-Sometime in 2014: First [deadlift I can remember trying](https://i.imgur.com/9KgqaRC.jpeg)


This was before I programmed it, and just wanted to demonstrate how much I could do to a friend. This was at a shitty 24 gym so I could not say how much the bar or those plates weighed. I am pretty sure the plates are 45lbs based on size and the bar is probably 30-35lbs. 

-October 2015: I am fairly sure this was the first time I [pulled 500](https://i.imgur.com/79Th4Ch.jpeg)

-April 2016: [First time pulling 600](https://youtu.be/dim8a2ApIio) I could not find anything about when I first hit 6 plate. 

-Aug 2017: First time pulling 635

-February 2018: First time pulling 7 plate and 700 (same day)

-December 2018: 725

-May 2022: 865lb, Nine Plate, Deadlift PR

There are a ton of other deadlift and deadlift adjacent PRs in there but the full list would be enormous. These are just highlights. 

**Training History**:

In the initial post I wrote the following: 
>Between the first pull in 2014 and some time around the 600 pull (I do not remember the exact dates) I started running nsuns 531LP. In nsuns 531 LP (5 day) you have two deadlift days, both with ~8 sets of varying weight and reps including one AMRAP on the primary deadlift day. The program suggests sumo deadlifts for the secondary deadlift day but I never clicked with them so I did deficit dead-lifts instead. This program definitely solidified my preexisting aptitude for deadlifts, and I believe the high volume was very beneficial when I was still pulling in this weight range. Despite a day dedicated to deficit work, I still found I was weakest off the ground. I also performed RDLs for a good portion of the time I ran this program as an accessory.
>After that I ran PHAT for about a month but did not like it do I moved on to nsuns CAP3. Nsuns CAP3 also had a primary deadlift day and a day where a deadlift variation was recommended. But stopped doing the variation at this point. The deadlift day was similar in having ~7 sets of deadlift, culminating in a single AMRAP set. At the beginning of the program I ran the full day, but by the end I just did warmups and enough of the initial sets to feel loose then put all my energy into the AMRAP. I ran nsuns CAP3 until the middle of last summer and it took me to the 700 pull. I did not do any deadlift specific accessory work while running CAP3. About the time I pulled 700 I found that I was no longer particularly weak off the ground.
>After nsuns CAP3 I ran my own variation of 531BBB. I had one deadlift day where I just did the 531 sets, the last of which being an AMRAP. Between the second half of my running CAP3 and this program, the last year and a half or so of my deadlift training has basically consisted of warming up and one single max effort AMRAP set a week.

I want to start off by saying that the year and change I did my own programming after 765 was the least productive period of my training career. Seriously, don’t try to do your own programming until you are very experienced, and even then start off with modifying existing programs *slightly*. I am almost a decade in now and only have only recently started to feel that I can really fully program for myself. 

Since then I have run several programs, including a mangled Deepwater, PH3, and Average to Savage 2.0. I have taken ideas from other programs including Gamma Bomb, and 28 Free Programs. The last year plus of training I have been doing a lot of my own programming. The only periods of really focused deadlift training I have done have been in my fall/winter block of high intensity, high frequency Squat/Bench/Deadlift programming. I cover this program and include the spreadsheet in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/s8rgbl/rip_and_tear_program_review_and_discussion_of/?ref=share&ref_source=link) and am working with a training app to possibly get it available for free in an even more user friendly format. 

Other than that my deadlift training has been sporadic. I have trained it a few times with specific goals in mind. Leading up to the 585 x 20 pull I spent 6 weeks pulling 585 x 20 from the floor with increasingly small blocks in a Range or Motion progression method. I found this worked pretty well. Its biggest benefit is that it builds confidence. If you start at a height that is ‘easy’ and work down in small increments you go into each set being pretty sure you can do it. 

Besides these bouts and my fall/winter block I have stopped training deadlifts. Up until todays pull I have barely touched deadlift in the last two months. Most of my deadlift work is in the form of PR attempts and challenge sets in variations of deadlift. I have come to the conclusion that I know how to deadlift, the technique is seared into my soul. I don’t really gain anything from practice at this point. What I do gain, however, is a lot of fatigue. I can’t keep up with a high frequency deadlift program unless I drop the intensity to a pointless level. I put my focus these days into building the strength and size of my muscle with movements other than deadlift, then testing that gain in PR attempts at some later point. 

I will say, in capitals, that I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SUPPORT THIS APPROACH FOR THE VAST, *VAST* MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. Almost everyone has room for technical improvement in their deadlifts. Very few people are going to have my innate proclivity for the movement. 99.9999% of people are not moving my loads and gathering the kind of fatigue I am. This is a case of do as I say, not as I do. Please train your deadlift, and do not point to me as an excuse for why deadlifts have a bad stimulus to fatigue ratio. I am an exception, you are (probably) not. 

The last thing I will say is that I am making use of a wide variety of deadlift variants. This is not so much a training method, as I don’t use any of them regularly either, but challenging myself with PR sets in other pulling motions helps build my bodily awareness and confidence in pulls. I talk a bit about this idea in [this post about unusual lifting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tagy4l/the_odd_the_old_and_the_original_the_case_for/?ref=share&ref_source=link). 

**Thoughts on Deadlift**:

In this section I will look at what I said 3 years ago, and amend the statements with my new thoughts, and include new insights that I have gathered since then. 

>Set up is the most important aspect of deadlift. I think it is important in all compounds, but deadlift most of all. If you are set up properly when you start pulling the weight off the ground the lift is going to sort itself off pretty much on it's own. It's a simple movement pattern, the weight is below you and 'hanging' so it has little chance to move out of the center of gravity. The most valuable cue is to pull the slack out of/pre-load the bar.

I still believe this 100%, if anything I would emphasize it even more. The setup is an integral part of a lift and often gets neglected compared to the portion of the lift where you are actually moving. A rock solid setup is the foundation of every lift. In a deadlift, particularly in a single, you need to pull a very heavy weight from a standstill. If you aren’t mentally and physically set up to go from 0 to 60 you are going to lift less than you could be. Most people fail at the floor, and of those that fail higher many fail because they messed up breaking the floor. 

>At high weights, the high volume approach does not work well unless you are using very sub-maximal weights. For the first few weeks of my BBB programming, I tried to do the deadlift BBB sets as well as my squat and front squat BBB sets (5x10 @ 55-60%). This was the first time I ever tweaked something without a single obvious moment in which the injury was caused. I did something to my lower back just from sheer overuse between all those sets. After that I dropped the deadlift BBB sets.

I am still pretty much on board with this. I have gone even father and now look at movements like squat, bench and deadlifts as movements I train to become a better squatter, bencher or deadlifter, not as movements I train to get bigger and stronger generally (though that certainly is a side benefit). I would never use a 5 x 10 compound as a general purpose hypertrophy movement these days, I think there are better alternatives. Most of my barbell compound training these days is a couple relatively easy sets to build technical expertise, then a single hard set to push myself. I don’t use multiple difficult sets for anything other than specific challenges. I do not think this is a universal truth though. It is my personal preference. Plenty of people have built themselves almost exclusively on big compounds, its just not for me. 

>Lowbar squats are an exceptional accessory to deadlifts. I spent over a year doing deficit pulls and still found breaking the floor to be a weakness. After my 635 pull I injured my forearm doing some tricep work and didnt deadlift until about a month before my 700 pull. In this time I heavily focused on lowbar instead, raising it 50lbs. Before this time I was heavily limited in what I could 1RM by weakness off the floor compared to what I could do for multiple reps. Afterwards I never saw it to be a significant weakpoint. I cannot say for sure it was the lowbar focus but I believe it was.

I don’t know if Lowbar is an accessory to deadlift, but I think they feed into each other and both benefit from similar support training. They compliment each other well if your goal is to have big squats and big deads. An issue with them, however, is they have a lot of overlap in muscles used. Part of the reason I have really pulled back on deadlift training is to allow more room for squatting. I still benefit from practicing squats, the more I can work with them the better I can squat. I would go so far as to say if you want to train low bar and conventional deadlift you should probably periodize them at a certain point. If not dropping one movement when working the other at least pick one to reign it back on. But that is just my experience, some people might be able to juggle them better if they have different technique than I do. 

>Touch and go is a completely valid and viable approach to dead lift sets. I do all of my deadlift work touch and go. For me trying to re-establish position and tightness once already fatigued is an issue. With touch and go I never lose position and tightness, so I can push my sets until my muscles won't let me anymore. This is important when my training has boiled down to basically one set a week. On a similar vein, hex plates are not evil. Everything before the 635 pull was done with hex plates, they taught me proper bar control on the way down so as to not have the bar go caddywumpus. [Here is a video from ~~2~~5+ years ago of me doing 405x21 with hex plates](https://youtu.be/RLhMw_u-F9s)

Still support this one completely too. I don’t think they are ‘cheating’, I think that pushing yourself as hard as you can with touch and go versus deadstops is a better way to train deadlifts. I think that they force you to control the eccentric, and maintain a controlled barpath. I think that all of that makes you a better, stronger deadlifter. Also deadstop deadlifts are just a series of singles, its like re-racking the bar between squats, change my mind. 

I don’t think I would want to go back to deadlifting with hex plates though. 

>I do not think that everyone can/should train deadlifts as I have for the last couple years. I have a large natural aptitude for the movement and am moving big weights. When I take a deadlift set to failure, it is to real failure. My AMRAPs on bench and squat fail do in large part to form breakdown as well as muscle failure, my deadlifts do not. I also am moving pretty big weights, so I can pull a lot of stimulus from a single set. If you feel that you are very good (either by natural aptitude or extensive training) at the deadlift form and are moving heavy weights feel free to give it a shot, but if you don't meet those criteria I do not recommend '1 AMRAP a week' as a valid training style.

I already covered this, please don’t try to train like me unless you are also a deadlift savant, you will no get my results. 

Besides these older ideas, which I have not really shifted from it seems, I have some new thoughts. 
Right after pulling 765 I started using straps. I think that training with straps is great, and that you probably should just use them unless you want to powerlift, and even then you should use them in some of your training. When I used mixed grip, a lot of my sets were held back by my grip. My *peak* grip strength was fine, on a good day my PR sets were fine. But not every day is a good grip day. In my experience, grip fluctuates a lot more than the rest of my body, and suffers from systemic fatigue a lot. This meant that I was leaving reps, and sets, on the table when pulling without straps. This held back my training for no good reason. So I started using straps. I still use them for every set because I have no interest in competing in powerlifting, and because I don’t want to start switching back to mixed grip for PR sets. Not only would it suck to fail a set for something as stupid as grip, I don’t think suddenly switching part of my technique (arm orientation) for PR sets is a smart move. 

I’ve also recently started working with a belt for heavy sets. I did not understand how to use a belt for deadlifts for the longest time. Over the last few years I have gotten much better at bracing into a belt, and no longer need to cinch it as tight as possible. This means it no longer gets in the way when deadlifting, so I am working it in. I also recently got a soft underbelt, and I really really like how that feels for deadlifts with the leather lifting belt. I’ll probably continue to use it on heavy sets, but leave it off on longer sets so I can breath more easily. 
The last big thing is I have worried a lot less about a strict deadlift. I have learned how to modify my technique to get the most out of my body and it’s not as pretty, that for sure. But I am not lifting to create a pretty deadlift. I am lifting to pick up the heaviest thing I can. I am going to use my body in the configuration that gives me the most power and stability. This is something that all the odd deadlifts and pulls has really helped me to develop. 

I will also note that, yes, I am aware that I pulled this PR Jefferson. Jefferson stance and Conventional stance have always been close and I just happened to be testing Jefferson maxes today. I have no issue considering this a deadlift PR. It was pulled from the floor and I do not think Jefferson gives any kind of strict benefit over conventional or sumo. I will probably pull 9 plates conventional soon, but this is my first 9 plate pull and I am treating it as such.

**Preparation**:

> To prepare for this lift, and for my bench and squat PR attempts next week I start tapering down volume two week ago. I reduced accessories, and switched my 5x10s for 3-4x4-5s while working up to heavy singles in place of the AMRAPs on a normal 531 week. This last week I just did the work up to heavy singles and some trivial accessories. This week I am taking off the gym period. I planned to do this lift and be peaked this weekend but I was feeling fine yesterday and figured I would give 8 plate a try as I could always try again this weekend if I failed.

I have basically stopped trying to prepare for big deadlifts, or any lift. I do not like operating under a looming deadline for my goals. I don’t like the pressure of having to lift a PR on a specific day. I don’t find that I can really predict when I will be strongest or reliably produce the conditions to hit big lifts. So I let them come when they do. I didn’t prepare for this. I set out planning to hit 820 as part of an entry in an online lifting meet. After it moved so well I hit 840, then 865. I have developed a good deal of patience in my lifts and have embraced the idea that there are a million things you can PR on. I go into more detail on that in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/owm6yc/anything_can_be_a_pr_broadening_your_horizons_to/?ref=share&ref_source=link), but the general take away here is there is no reason to push yourself against a plateau in a handful of areas. Take a step back, pick something else to focus on, go PR in that, then circle back around later and tackle your old goals when you are bigger and stronger. 

**Moving Forward**: 

>Moving forward I am going to cut for a while, then spend some time reading the 531 books and trying to vary my training a bit, with more periodization. Up until now I have picked a program and ran it for months-years, and its worked alright. But I've noticed that while my muscles are up to heavy singles right now, my joints and form is not really handling it as well as I could be, because I have been working with submaximal weight for about a year since the last time I really tried PRs. I hope to work more periods with high weight into my future training so I can keep things from getting rusty. These thoughts are more for my other lifts, as I am pretty much convinced that deadlifts will keep going up for me regardless of what I do. I am confident I will hit 800 in a year with 9 plates being the next stretch goal.

Well for one I never read those 531 books. I pretty much realized that I don’t like 531 and should not run it. It’s a great program, its just not for me. My “muscle were not up to heavy singles” because my programming then and for a good while after was dogshit, as I already discussed. I would go on to add a grand total of 10lbs onto my Bench/Squad/Deadlift total after this post over like a year and a half. I did hit that 800 a year after I planned, and here I am today with the 9 plates. I was right that deadlift would inevitably go up doing pretty much anything though. 

Moving forward now is a lot more vague. My training goals these days are lot more varied. I will hit 9 plate conventional pretty soon, I hope. From there I think I will try to pull 900 as a lifetime PR goal. I would love to hit it on a deadlift bar, but I plan to buy a 10ft Elephant style bar someday and if I cant get 900 on the deadlift bar I will do it with that instead. My barbell deadlift 1RM PR is now officially higher than my Trap Bar 1RM so maybe it’s time to revisit Trap Bar. Other than that I am just going to keep pulling whatever strikes my fancy and continue to try and become one of the best all around deadlifters/pullers ever. 

I hope that you got some value from my reflections here. I know that this is a lot less directly applicable to most people than most of my other posts, but I wrote this one just as much for me as I did for everyone else. Here’s hoping I can come back at some point and write about the road to 10 plates.",2022-05-17 02:32:55

Research Review: Do Oral Contraceptives Affect Your Gains? • Stronger by Science,514,ugu5v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ugu5v6/research_review_do_oral_contraceptives_affect/,30,1651510617.0,"#Link to Article: [Do Oral Contraceptives Affect Your Gains?](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/oral-contraceptives/)

Our self-appointed BFFs at Stronger by Science have a new research review on the topic of contraceptives based on past learnings and [a recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054662/).  The study examined the effects of oral contraceptives on strength gains, hypertrophy, and anabolic signaling.  Their article goes into a key question we see regularly: Do female lifters need to worry about hormonal contraceptives affecting their gains?

**tl;dr - ""If you choose to use hormonal contraceptives, you probably don’t need to worry about your gains.""**

Key points include

>* Strength gains and hypertrophy were not significantly different between groups. However, the subjects using oral contraceptives tended to have larger increases in lean body mass, along with some molecular indicators of anabolism.

>* When analyzing these results within the context of the rest of the literature, it doesn’t seem that second- or third-generation oral contraceptives have a meaningful effect on strength or hypertrophy outcomes.

Of note to me was the section calling out that any slight or potentially non-trivial edge is often less important than other reasons oral contraceptives are used.

>the research suggests that you probably don’t need to think about your gains when you’re deciding whether to start, stop, or change oral contraceptives.

plus

>	the most commonly discussed reasons for using or not using oral contraceptives (contraception, more control over your period, managing menstrual symptoms, etc.) seem like the most justifiable reasons

Also of note was that these studies and findings are largely based on oral contraceptives and do not include other methods like hormonal IUDs that have grown in popularity over the years.  More (hopefully!) to come.

>There are a lot of forms of hormonal contraception that haven’t yet been studied in a resistance training context. We don’t know how the minipill (progestin-only oral contraception), fourth-generation combination pills, hormonal IUDs, intravaginal inserts, or progestin injections affect strength and hypertrophy",2022-05-02 19:56:57

"21M/6'/190lbs. Alright, Fitness community it has been about 8 months now. I just got a DEXA scan today. I'm going to give you guys a cr@p ton of data through text and images. Tell me what you think!",65,u58407,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/u58407/21m6190lbs_alright_fitness_community_it_has_been/,25,1650145826.0,"**Dexa and other images:** [https://imgur.com/a/JV59CZ7](https://imgur.com/a/JV59CZ7)

TL:DR

Over the past 8 months, I've lost about 40lbs of weight and 8% body fat. I'm proud of my progress but would like to start to lean bulk soon. However, I will do so only after I gain some non flexed ab visibility (or just some visibility period). It's a purely symbolic goal that means a lot to me and I'm going to achieve it however long it takes. Given everything I've shown, how much longer do you think I've got.

  
**Info**

I've been lifting on and off for about 6 years starting freshman year of high school in 2015. This is the longest consistent stretch though. I'm a 21-year-old 6' male that went from 225lbs to 190lbs and 23.9% to 14.7% body fat over 8 months. So about 8 months ago in August of last year, I finished up my bulk and was 225lbs. I then began cutting eating around 2500 calories a day from then until around mid-March when I started aggressively cutting eating around 2000 calories a day. I did this because I was tired of cutting and would like to start putting on some more size and lean bulking.

**Diet**  
I ate about 3 meals a day and usually snacked on a protein bar or a protein shake.

A log of what I ate for a month can be seen here:  
https://imgur.com/YUBEWzI   


Breakfast was usually something highly satiating that would last me until mid-afternoon around 3.   
Lunch would be something light that would hold me over till dinner.  
I usually ate my snack around 6PM this would satiate any hunger that came between lunch and dinner.  
Dinner would be something high in volume and dense with protein but still kinda low calorie. I like to eat, so something high in volume was necessary to keep this sustainable.

Supplements: Creatine, Pre-workout, Bodyfortress whey protein 

&#x200B;

**Workout Routine**  
I workout 3 days a week for a little over an hour using a PPL split. I try to increase the weight for each workout. I alternate the first workout on my push, pull, and leg days. First is either Bench, Deadlift, Squat or Overhead Press, Barbell Row, RDL.   


Here are some screenshots of some of my previous lifts

As for cardio, I'm a Mechanical engineering student at UT Austin. I get most of my cardio walking and biking around campus. In the fall I did boxing sessions for an hour or so every Saturday and shadowboxed every other day for about 20min. This Spring from Feb to mid-March I swam for an hour about twice a week. I've kinda fallen off that now thanks to midterms but thought I'd mention it anyway.  


As for sleep, I generally get about 5 hours of sleep a night usually going to bed around 2 AM. College life ;p.  
 https://imgur.com/4tEgReE 

&#x200B;

**Stats**  
I haven't been giving Overhead press or Row much love so I'm not going to list their numbers here as there hasn't been much growth.

Bench before bulk: 235 3x5  https://imgur.com/Y3JlSdE 

Bench now: 225 3x5  https://imgur.com/ThViTVg 

(I am trying to maintain 225 as I continue my cut. As of the past month, it's starting to get hard now. I usually choke on the last rep.)

Squat before bulk: 225 3x5  https://imgur.com/ukFB3pq 

Squat now: 295 3x5  https://imgur.com/gW113eB 

Deadlift before bulk: 225 3x5  https://imgur.com/lP3Ml5J 

Deadlift now: 350 3x5  https://imgur.com/y5k8X5m 

I've just been trying to maintain and build as much muscle mass as I can as I cut. Honestly, I feel like I can deadlift and squat more. I think it's just mental now.

I am now about 190lbs so about 40lbs of weight lost. According to my electronic scale, I was about 26.9% body fat in August though it was more likely 23% body fat. According to DEXA, I am about 14.7 percent body fat now and my scale currently reads me at 17.9% body fat. I'd like to believe the DEXA is more accurate than my scale, so my scale is off by about -3%.

  
**Conclusion**

So yeah that's about it. I'm pretty proud of my progress I think it's decent. Though as I mentioned before I would like to start to lean bulking soon. However, I will only do so after I gain some non flexed ab visibility. I know abs aren't all that it's just a purely symbolic goal for me. I've been fat all my life and would like to see some abs on my frame to prove to myself that I can do it. Purely symbolic but it means a lot to me.

So given all the DEXA and all the other data and factors, I've shown and told you, how much longer do you think I must cut to see some ab visibility? I'm in no hurry, I'm willing to go the distance. Just curious really.

&#x200B;

Any other comments on my progress you feel are worth sharing are appreciated as well.

Thanks!",2022-04-17 00:50:26

The latest research spotlight from Stronger by Science showcasing a new meta-analysis on the [interference effect](https://thefitness.wiki/faq/does-cardio-impair-muscle-gains/):

[Compatibility of Concurrent Aerobic and Strength Training for Skeletal Muscle Size and Function: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757594/) by Schumann et al.

The review concluded that concurrent strength and endurance training does not compromise hypertrophy or strength gains. However, explosive strength gains may be attenuated.

The article briefly explains the results and then follows up with some real-world context.  It provides thoughts on the realities and concerns of balancing the training load of both endurance and resistance training.  I know a lot of people around here won't be surprised by these results, but it may be reassuring news to others.  

>Previously, the default assumption was that the interference effect generally mattered quite a bit, and that it was the goal of a coach to find the exact right mix of training variables to mitigate the interference effect to the greatest extent possible. However, I think the overall balance of evidence now suggests that the interference effect isn’t *that* big of a deal, and you probably don’t need to be *that* concerned about it most of the time.",2022-04-13 23:44:01

140 -> 130lbs and all lifts up.

Online coaching is great.

&#x200B;

**Why Online Coaching?**

I live in Melbourne and we went through a lockdown of over 260 days.  Gyms were closed and I ate way too much with the misguided belief that I was 'bulking'.  All the while, I struggled to get enough intensity in my home workouts.  In short, a recipe for disaster.  So when the gyms re-opened, I decided to make a big change and what better motivation than getting a coach and putting my money on the line?

&#x200B;

**A little About Me**

I'm male, 34, about 5'4"" and currently sitting at 130lbs.  I've always had a fairly narrow frame and I if you could imagine a tall, handsome, naturally athletic person, and then think of everything that is the opposite, you'd have a fair image of me.  I work as a psychologist, so the gym is my way of offsetting all that carcinogenic sitting (sitting is the new smoking, as they say).

&#x200B;

**A Brief Training History**

I am the definition of a late bloomer.  After a lifetime of no physical activity, I started going to the gym in my 30s and worked with a PT for nine months, then cycled through 5/3/1, Reddit PPL, PHAT, and then RPs Physique Template.  Of course, all of this was brutally disrupted by the joys of COVID, so I'm still a bit of a beginner in the gym.

&#x200B;

**The Program - Weight Training**

I splurged and bought the combo plan (diet and weight training).  Since I was in my dreamer bulk, I started with a fat loss phase with a heavy focus on shoulders because I wanted to be able to lift heavy things overhead.

Each mesocycle in my program is about six weeks.  RP uses reps from failure to regulate intensity, or the number of reps left in the tank after completing a set.  The first week is a breeze, with just 2-3 sets per exercise and four reps from failure.  The intensity increases each week with added sets, increased weight, and closer proximity to failure, with week five being 4-5 sets per exericse, increased weight and only one rep from failure.  Generally, my week 1 workouts take about 30 minutes whereas week 5 takes 1.5-2 hours depending on my level of fatigue.

The program I'm on is  five full-body workouts a week, with a different focus on each day:

Day 1 - chest and shoulder focus

Day 2 - legs and shoulder focus

Day 3 - back and shoulder focus

Day 4 - legs and shoulder focus

Day 5 - full body

&#x200B;

An example of day 1, week 1:

Incline DB chest press | 2 sets | 30 lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 4/fail

Seated DB shoulder press | 2 sets | 27.5lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 4/fail

DB skull crushers | 3 sets | 15lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 4/fail

Straight bar cable curls | 2 sets | 33lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 4/fail

Bent over barbell row | 2 sets | 66lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 4/fail

DB walking lunge | 2 sets | 25lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 4/fail

&#x200B;

And then day 1 week 5:

Incline DB chest press | 5 sets | 35 lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 1/fail

Seated DB shoulder press | 5 sets | 30lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 1/fail

DB skull crushers | 5 sets | 20lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 1/fail

Straight bar cable curls | 5 sets | 43lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 1/fail

Bent over barbell row | 4 sets | 99lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 1/fail

DB walking lunge | 4 sets | 32.5lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 1/fail

&#x200B;

*Things I liked*

* The increase in intensity over the five weeks gave an amazing sense of progression
* It was easy to set goals for each exercise in each workout (one more rep than last week, or to try to match reps if the weight had increased)
* Using reps from failure ensured I didn't push too hard too early so I'd have a great peak week
* The program structure made it easy to hit PRs in week 5 which felt amazing

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Sometimes the length of the workouts meant I only had enough time to complete 80% of the workout - this probably has occurred 5-6 times
* Reps from failure is a great system to regulate intensity but not easy to judge and takes a lot of practice, and it's easy to stuff it up
* The fatigue by week five is seriously a killer and made me not want to go to the gym some days

&#x200B;

**The Program - Nutrition**

The diet plan comes in the form of an excel diet template.  I'm now into my fifth template - four fat loss phases and one in maintenance.  I was given macro targets for each meal based on when I work out, as well as macro targets for rest days.  The template also includes calculators to help with meal prep and a list of recommended foods in the categories of lean proteins, healthy carbs, healthy fats, workout carbs, and veggies.

For reference, my macros:

* At the start of the fat loss phase - 140g protein / 170g carbs / 37.5g fats
* Final fat loss phase - 140g protein / 110g carbs / 15g fats
* Current maintenance - 140g protein / 150g carbs / 45g fats

&#x200B;

*Things I liked*

* Having a list of recommended foods made meal prep simpler
* The calculators were very handy for figuring out the amounts of different ingredients
* Having so much lean protein and veggies in most of my meals meant I was almost never hungry
* Eating more food than before and losing weight faster than before is amazing

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Having the limited list of recommended foods got a little boring, particularly as my macros got reduced in subsequent templates
* You probably need some experience with calorie counting and RPs dieting principles, or you're in for a big adjustment
* Everything else was great.  This was easily the most sustainable and successful diet I've tried and I feel like I could keep this going for a very, very long time

&#x200B;

**The Coaching**

All the comms with my coach was via email.  At the start, we helpfully spent quite a bit of time figuring out goals.  I get three check-in emails a week where I log my basic stats (weight, diet adherence, and fatigue), as well as regular check-ins if there are any changes or when my program is updated.  My coach always responds within 24-hours and I was encouraged to send videos for feedback on my form.

&#x200B;

*Things I liked*

* Fast response times to all my questions
* Having someone to go to when I had uncertainty about my training was helpful for sticking it out
* I got helpful advice when I wasn't sure how to handle a situation, such as when I got sick, or how to manage my diet on a weekend away
* The check-ins helped a lot with my adherence to the program
* The video form checks were great.  I have a history of pain when doing lat pulldowns and with a few video form checks I have a smoother movement and I'm lifting heavier and pain free

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Communication via email isn't always easy and some questions required quite a bit of back and forth

&#x200B;

**The Results**

I guess this is what really matters!  I've listed my main lifts except for overhead press, as the first mesocycle had db shoulder press and the final was barbell shoulder press.  As an alternative, I've listed my progress on db lateral raises.  Also my results would probably be slightly better except I ran a 14.8k fun run with no training and had to take a few days off, and then came down with a cold during peak week... genius stuff!

|Squat|16x143lbs|12x192lbs|
|Deadlift|11x165lbs|15x203.5lbs|

&#x200B;

*Things I liked*

* My lifts went up quite a bit even though I was cutting for almost the entire four months
* I lost quite a bit of fat and seem to have gained a little muscle along the way

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Changing the lifts was enjoyable but obviously makes it harder to compare and track progression

**Final Thoughts - was it worth it?**

Yes.  Absolutely worth it.  I've been spending hundreds of dollars on my gym membership over the years without a lot of success.  In other words, throwing money and time down the drain.  I'm looking this as an investment that's making going to the gym worthwhile for achieving my goals.

Having an online coach has helped a lot with adherence and motivation, and I've managed a streak of five months of workouts five times a week.  I learned how lose fat more easily and with less hunger, I learned how to push myself harder in the gym, and I finally had the experience of success in changing my body composition.

I intend to keep working with my coach for at least another six months as we head into a bulk, and I am beyond excited.  I hope that if you've ever wondered about online coaching or RP that this has been in some way helpful.  And if you're thinking about it... I'd recommend taking the plunge!",2022-04-08 16:23:13

I'm just poking a little fun at my last post lol. Anyways, here's this to start:

Background: below this little paragraph, I'll put the link to the six month mark post. That'll detail the previous background up until the six month mark, including starting weights and six month finishing weights. This post will extend from then up until now.

Previous post link: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pw2ged/my_six_month_journey_from_very_underweight_to/)

As for now, it's feels pretty much the same lol. My routine is basically the same with some tweaks and additions. The main differences in the past few months are a job position change, which has caused a diet change because of the new hours I've been working. I've also worked through a variety of injuries, which I've learned quite a bit about, which I'll include in a separate notes section down below. Also, for my updated routine, I included a LOT more detail this time, which is going to make it seem super long, so bear with me.

All x2, Every Other Day

So yeah, there's that. I usually do this six days a week, barring any outside circumstances. 

As for my diet, same as the last post. I'm eating typically the same things every day, but they're different from what they were before. The list in the included screenshot is a lot, and that's what I'd ideally eat every day, but there are days where I miss certain items. Either way, I try to make sure what I eat is at least over 3000 calories at the bare minimum. I also reduced the amount of protein I was eating (which in the last post was wayyyy overboard), reduced the amount of sodium, and added more carbs instead. Everything is listed in the screenshots below.

[New Diet](https://imgur.com/a/np3tf3e) 

Other things to include:  
- Since the last post, I've used pre-workout before every time I've gone to the gym. I personally use Pre-Jym, but I may switch since I'm getting a little sick of it, it's a little sugary, it's a massive scoop, and I have to drink quite a bit of water because of the scoop size. We'll see.  
- Since the last post, I've used creatine after every workout, even on my off days. I tried to remember to take it even during extended periods of days where I didn't go to the gym, but sometimes it wasn't possible. See below.  
- I battled quite a few injuries and I learned a lot from it. These include: elbow tendonitis, bicep tendonitis, and multiple pulled back muscles. This, coupled with covid for a week, set me back about a cumulative total of a month of lost gym days.  
- Hot damn, my leg days and weights skyrocketed these past six months out of nowhere.  
- I did hit 225 on my bench on the session after I decided to cut off this post, so it's not included in the weight above because I felt like it would be cheating (lol), but I did do it!

Main things I've learned:  
- Accessory workouts are HUGELY important for ""forgotten"" muscle groups, especially when you get to higher weights. Some of the injuries that I had weren't do to overuse, but rather, overload.  
- Elbow tendonitis: I had both golfer's and tennis elbow at both the same and different times on my left arm. It would hurt to bench sometimes, on lat pulldowns, face pulls, etc. Turns out it was two things. 1) Gripping with my fingertips too much and not in the main part of my hand. 2) My forearms and area surrounding my elbow wasn't strong enough to support the loads I was lifting. I had to essentially rehab and strengthen that area of my arms to fix and prevent injury. Some of the rehab work I did at home while relaxing, and I was able to ease thru workouts still to some degree without losing days.  
- Bicep tendonitis: this one was harder to figure out. It would hurt while benching at times, while overhead pressing, lat pulldowns, and would even hurt just to pick up weights it got so bad. Turns out it was because I wasn't working out my rotator cuffs at all. I won't break down the full explanation, because I'm not a doctor or physical therapist, but once I started to add rotator cuff exercises in and really focus on them, it slowly went away. I started that rehab at home as well, so I could slowly still go to the gym without missing days.  
- Back injuries: I don't even know what caused the first one, but it wasn't at the gym. That one was the worst pain of my life, and I kept going to the gym thru it. Eventually it got to the point I could barely breath and had to go to urgent care twice. The second one somehow popped in the middle of one rep on a squat set. I worked out thru that one too and had it for a little over a month until about a few weeks ago. I'm stubborn. Don't be like me. With the back ones, I learned to just take the week off and let it fully heal. Yeah, sure, I didn't miss days because I worked thru it. But the workouts did get painful and that got annoying. I'd rather just take the week off and not have to feel pain doing every workout, every day at this point.

Things I'm working on:  
- DEADLIFTS. I still didn't do it (lol). Now that my back is better, I'm going to start now.
- My next goal is to join the 1000 club. I did hit 225 on the bench between my cutoff date for this post and the actual day this got posted. I'm sure I can do one rep of 315 while squatting too. The only thing I'd have left, which is now why I have to start it, is the deadlift (lol). I know I can at least do one rep of 195 decently easily, since there have been times where I'm forced to deadlift it off the ground to start sets of barbell rows when I don't have a rack.  
- Lowkey, at this point, I kind of want to leg press 1000 pounds for reps now... 

Things holding me back:  
- Weight gain. Mannn, I try to eat well over 3000 calories in a day. It's been like a month since I've gained even 3 solid, non-fluctuating pounds. I've gotten stronger still, but no weight gains. I don't know why.  I mean, I do, but I don't.  
- My job has been active the whole time I've been working out. To estimate, I used to walk at least 20k steps a day. Now, I probably walk at least 16k steps a day and am lifting and moving boxes and stuff around often. This plays into the above bullet point. Can't really change that, but can I even stomach eating more than I do in a day? Ehhhh... 

But yeah, ultimately that's my full year progress, journey, and guide to where I'm at now. I'm open to suggestions on any aspect of what I've done so far, whether it be focus exercises or dietary changes, so please let me know! I'm not sure if I'll post or update on this again, as I feel pretty content with the year mark. Plus, I'm pretty lazy and it took me a hot minute, spread over days, to even make this post. But again, thank you all very much and good luck on your journeys!",2022-04-03 14:06:03

Hello /r/fitness! I am on the journey of losing weight/becoming healthier. I am primarily trying to lose the fat/build some strength(I know it will be harder to build big muscles on a deficit, so I'm mainly just going for strength gains). I plan on trying a modified version of 5/3/1 while also mixing in about 1-2 hours of cardio every week.

A deficit for me with 4-5 days of exercise is about 2400 cal. I plan on prepping for 6 days a week. Saturday will be a sorta cheat day (eat whatever I want but still try to stay within 2400 cal). So here is the plan I came up with.

[Meal Plan](https://imgur.com/a/bqgGiqw) (the garlic and spinach will be thrown into lunch and dinner, I just didn't count them as they have such few calories)

I am a picky eater so I know it's a little basic. I know there are some really good foods like avocados, but I absolutely hate them. 

I'm wondering what you all think. Will these macros work for what I'm trying to do? Any other super foods you recommend? (except avocados)",2022-04-01 17:41:41

LSD microdose as preworkout,2936,ttopsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ttopsi/lsd_microdose_as_preworkout/,564,1648813565.0,"In my experience LSD 10 - 15ug (1/10 of the standard street dose) is almost the perfect preworkout.

-

Edit - This is not a recommendation that anyone tries microdosing as a pre workout! These are simply the effects I observed. Don’t follow in my footsteps, I’m a dumbass.

-

LSD is nontoxic and nonaddictive, but can be dangerous for those with mental disorders like schizophrenia. If you struggle with your hold on reality then please avoid psychedelics and psychotropic drugs in general (including peds). I would also avoid it if you have a substance use disorder as like all drugs it *can* be abused.

Below is my list of all the performance related effects of microdosing lsd. 


Effects -

Increased energy - 
The increased energy is potent but never feels forced and one can sit still if need be but one feels encouraged to move. This is comparable to a average dose of caffeine and lasts approx 8 hours.

Appetite suppression - 
This effect is far stronger then what is provided by caffeine and can rival a low dose of amphetamine (this also lasts around 8 hours so it’s perfect for a fast). Eating big meals can become impossible and small meals of fruits and oats are preferred.

Wakefulness aid - 
This effect is more then just the increased energy mentioned above. Most people will find it *impossible* to sleep within 8-12 hours after LSD, even at a microdose. This effect is most comparable to 150mg of modafinil. 

Increased strength -
I always find that I can lift more / perform more reps after a microdose. It’s almost like my mental limiter has been removed. This effect is most pronounced within the first 4-6 hours of the experience.

Euphoria -
LSD can be very euphoric. The effect is not as potent at a microdose level, but it boosts the post workout euphoria by a huge margin.

Decreased boredom and increased music appreciation-
Honestly I could workout all day after a microdose and never get bored. You feel very creative and in the moment and music sounds absolutely amazing, this is even more the case after the endorphins start pumping.

Increased coordination -
As a fairly athletic person, I play a lot of spots with my main being skateboarding. I have filmed and landed most of my best tricks after a microdose. It’s almost like my body movement is more precise and my coordination skills / self confidence is off the charts.

Down sides - 
Biggest downsides to me are appetite suppression while bulking and the instant tolerance. LSD can only be microdosed 1 to 2 times a week (every 4 days), otherwise the positive effects begin to fade. If you have over used it a built up a high tolerance then a 2 week long brake will reduce your tolerance back to baseline.

People who suffer from anxiety may also want to avoid psychedelics. Psychedelics  often cause and increase anxiety in people who are prone to it, I personally experience this and avoid it if my anxiety levels are higher then normal on that day / week.


Please share any experiences / effects you may have had with microdosing and working out.

Edit 2 - This is not a April’s fools post, just bad timing. I’m interested in pharmacology and try to discuss substance use in a prejudice free manner.

A microdose should have little to no subjective effects. These doses don’t cause hallucinations, mania or sensory effects.",2022-04-01 14:46:05

That’s absolute bare minimum. According to his research, most people past beginner will need more. So if we just add 1 more set for each body part, now we’re at 29 sets in a workout.

Unconventional question about relationship between height and weight.,0,ttdkk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ttdkk8/unconventional_question_about_relationship/,5,1648772012.0,"So I've scoured the rules, including the entire list of banned topics in Rule 2, and I *think* I'm in the clear here. Whether or not this is the right place to be asking this question's another thing entirely, but I'm hoping I can get some help here.   
I'm a scraggly writer. Furthermore, I'm a scraggly writer who can't work out due to a disability. The relevance here is that I have a character who's got a bodybuilder physique, and I'm trying to get a sense of how much he'd weigh. The complicated part is that he's seven and a half feet tall (and this is sounding dumber the further I go, but press on I shall.) I looked at over-simplistic weight charts and calculators and tried to extrapolate to someone his size, but it tends to break down.   
After that, I found the heights and weights of different bodybuilders and likely-phony instagram fitness gurus who looked like they had the same general shape as him, and I got an average of the ratios of their height in cm to their weight in kg. I tried applying it to my guy, but it seems inaccurate to me too. He's seven and a half feet tall, but using this method, he'd only weigh 250 pound, which sounds to my inexperienced ears like a huge undershoot. So here's me asking for more experienced opinions. Based on your actual experiences -as opposed to my frantic, pointless Googling- how heavy should this guy be? (For reference, some of the builds I used for my calculations were Ali Bilal, Ryan J. Terry, and Anton Antipov. I know they're probably completely un-serious instagrammers, but they looked about right, so I went with it.)

I recently just started up the gym after a 2~3 year hiatus. Decided to chat with one of the employees about possibly getting a personal trainer. 

He did [this](https://i.imgur.com/1l4CFOj.jpg) body analysis thing on me that showed my segmental lean analysis and showed that my right leg had .8% more muscle mass than my left leg and suggested a few months of therapy for it with a personal trainer because anything above .3% was significant. My arm difference was .1% so it wasn’t a big deal.  

I know imbalances causing back problems or potential injuries are a real thing, but my back now feels fine. My right leg/arm has felt more dominant since I started working out in high school over 10 years ago, and from what I remember my right leg was stronger during certain leg workouts and held more during weighted leg workouts, which i remember getting weird lower back pain during those. 

So my main question is should I just do unilateral leg workouts for awhile to gain equal strength in my legs? Or should I actually pay a personal trainer to help me out?

200ml Milk, 50g Oats, 2 Tbsp Coconut Oil, 2 Scoops of Chocolate Whey Protein Powder (30g each), and 1 Whole Banana.

Now I've drank this before with no issue. But today, I had insane stomach pain and had to throw up the shake. The milk seemed fine although I may look at it again, I can't think of anything else here that would cause me to throw up.

I'm pretty bummed because I relied on this shake for the bulk of my daily calories as I am a broke college student with no time to cook, but after throwing up I'm not sure if I can make this again.

Machines and Freeweights,277,tskl9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tskl9h/machines_and_freeweights/,154,1648678020.0,"I'm sure this is a common question, but I've got other questions to add to it:

Soon, I'll be at a place where the only option might be machines without any free weights. I'm wondering the timeless question: Are machines good enough? Alright, now I'm asking from the perspective of health. I have gotten conflicting responses. What I've heard and read is that, if you do machines-only, you won't be training your stabilizers and could get injured as a result and generally have bad balance. So, anyone got answers that can be backed up? 

The second question is this (I think it adds a lot more to the original): if I do calisthenics along with machines, will that strengthen stabilizers enough? 

My goal is to be firstly healthy, secondly strong, and thirdly I am concerned with anesthetics.  My main concern is health with strength; I'm less worried about looks, but those are a big bonus, of course. I used to lift a lot, but have been on a long hiatus. I'm getting back into it. I train for functionality. I'll be getting back into MMA, as well, so I'm less concerned with anesthetics and more concerned with health and functionality. Aeathetics are a welcome bonus, though, of course.

EDIT: I guess what I'm afraid of is getting strong in an unhealthy way. Like have strong groups of isolated muscles, but not the rest of my body. Then I'd be both less functional and less healthy. For example: let's say we put a v8 into a Honda Civic and then tune it up for max HP and torque. But we don't also get good tires and don't tune gearing at all... so all you wind up doing is spinning out or losing control. It isn't a perfect example, but it conveys my thoughts decently. Big and strong, but not balanced,  not stable, and not functional

"Muscle Maintenance during Stress, Detraining, and Sickness",951,tplm2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tplm2u/muscle_maintenance_during_stress_detraining_and/,81,1648393030.0,"**Much of the discussion in fitness forums is based around achieving hypertrophy. One might think that to maintain muscle they are better off following hypertrophy-centric advice, but this is not always effective. Poor access to food, gyms, stress, life events, etc can make rigorous programs difficult to follow at all times. In understanding the minimum effort you can put in to maintain your muscle mass, you make yourself much more adaptable in pressing times.**

**There is a great security in knowing that you won't lose your progress should you need to focus on more important matters for some time.**

**This post will go over maintaining muscle in various contexts, both emotional and physical. Sources are included with the statistics themselves, I encourage anyone to look into sources for things they will apply to themselves.**

# Key concepts

**- The amount of protein you need to consume for nitrogen balance (net lean-mass maintenance) is dependent on your level of training, calories, and other macronutrients.**

**-** [**Carbohydrates spare protein needs more than fats**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/440521)**, but they cannot** [**alone induce nitrogen balance.**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7598072/)

**- Training one muscle will reduce the catabolism of other muscles by altering your endocrine environment (**[**mainly through IGF1, not testosterone**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24276305/)**), but this effect is not capable of completely protecting untrained muscles.**

# 1. Detraining/Unable to go to the gym

**In 75 year old men,** [**3 sets of 10 reps at 80% max was sufficient to maintain muscle mass in the targetted muscle over 12 weeks.**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11909878/)

**Keep in mind that these are 75-year-old men who ate maintenance calories, muscle-sparing in younger people is likely even more forgiving.**

# 2. At-home sickness (COVID, Flu, etc)

**Viral infections cause muscle wasting through activation of IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine. Check with your doctor if reducing inflammation is in your best interest, as they will know best based on your condition. If you are given the go-ahead on reducing inflammation, OTC aspirin and fish oil can help reduce levels of IL6 and muscle wasting.**

**UNLESS PRESCRIBED BY DOCTOR, DO NOT USE CORTICOSTEROIDS,** [**THEY CAUSE MUSCLE WASTING**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557731/)**.**

**As for training, calisthenics and makeshift dumbells are your best bet. Use exercises that do not hit too many muscles, as this will minimize cardiovascular load which might be strained during an infection. If you feel able to do compound calisthenics though, by all means, go ahead.**

**Diamond pushups, curls with makeshift dumbells, dynamic planks, leg raises, incline to calve raises, pull-ups (if able), lateral raises, and oblique planks can all be used to preserve muscle mass in all parts of the body.**

# 3. Bedridden

**Talk with your doctor to see if you're able to do some mild resistance training while in bed. If your limbs have been immobilized,** [**your muscles will begin to waste after around 1 week**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600281/)**. Ensure that your food is high in protein and that you are eating maintenance calories.**

# 4. High stress

**Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, promotes muscle protein breakdown and suppresses the immune system. Training and maintenance calories (and slight surplus) are two physical strategies to reduce cortisol. Carbohydrates may also help reduce cortisol,** [**but this effect is more pronounced at lower BF%**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893582/#:~:text=A%20diet%20high%20in%20carbohydrate,to%20prolonged%20exercise%20%5B64%5D)**. Practice stress-reduction techniques to reduce the cortisol increase caused by your emotional state.**

[**High cortisol puts you at risk for an infection**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465119/#:~:text=Cortisol%20is%20ordinarily%20anti%2Dinflammatory,the%20immune%20response%20%5B18%5D)**, and thus even more muscle wasting.**

**Furthermore, although exercise increases cortisol, it does so alongside the** [**release/upregulation of other anti-catabolic hormones**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469)**, and provides stress relief on its own. Cortisol in the absence of these coincident hormones is the real killer of lean mass.**

# 5. Sickness/Low appetite/Very Low calories

**During sickness, one may feel overwhelmingly satiated despite consuming very little food. This is likely due to the** [**appetite-blunting effects of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10657519/)**. Do not be fooled, however, muscle** [**protein breakdown is greatly increased during times of high inflammatory burden.**](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/132/7/1921/4687380)

**Carbohydrates and fats as well as caloric surplus can lower your protein need. If you are unable to stomach enough carbohydrates and fats to meet your maintenance, you need to up your protein intake. Your body will require much more protein to maintain nitrogen balance.**

**Experiments on subjects undergoing protein sparing modified fasting (PSMF), a diet consisting solely of 500-800 calories of lean protein, have demonstrated that muscle mass can be protected in times of severe caloric restriction by upping protein intake to** [**125-200g per day.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784653/)

**Try your hardest to eat at least 2.2g/kg protein. You do not need to eat beyond this but it is important that you reach this to avoid muscle wasting.**

# 6. Sleep deprivation

[**Even acute sleep deprivation is capable of reducing muscle protein synthesis.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785053/#:~:text=Acute%20sleep%20deprivation%20decreases%20muscle,promotes%20a%20catabolic%20hormonal%20environment) **Though you may not want to rely on supplements and medication to sleep, it might be important to use such ailments to reset the circadian rhythm and prevent muscle wasting.** [**Melatonin seems effective in resetting the circadian clock**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3696986/)**, even if its ability to induce sleep is debated.**

# Takeaway

**Maintaining muscle during simple detraining is surprisingly easy at maintenance calories. During infection and immobilization, though, it is important to meet your heightened protein needs BEFORE attempting to eat at maintenance calories. Using stress-reduction techniques can also make it easier to maintain muscle during pressing times.**",2022-03-27 17:57:10

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

This leads me to my question, if the Dumbbell Bench Press is a preferred exercise for hypertrophy for the chest, is there an alternative that is suggested in place of the Barbell Row?

Clarification on the 8-12-8 method for a noob,11,tjhci2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tjhci2/clarification_on_the_8128_method_for_a_noob/,14,1647884392.0,"Edit: This is the 8-12-8 method by Paul Carter. I think I may have wrongly assumed it to be more popular or well known than it is

Hi,

Apologies in advance if any of these are stupid questions; I've never really followed a routine before and I workout from home with limited equipment due to mental health issues so I'm not really sure on best practices etc.

I decided to do a little bit of research today as I keep hitting a limit with the current exercise routine.

I have a classic ""skinny-fat"" physique with fat around my waist / stomach etc. Everywhere else I look skinny and my muscles are particularly long / thin.

I had been training more for strength by trying to do 3 sets of 6 X 6, and when I could do 6x6 for all 3 sets I'd put the starting weight up and continue again until I could hit the 3 X 6 X 6.

I found that with this I was able to reach a certain point but it wasn't particularly helping me gain visible muscle and I would always end up hitting a wall which I could not pass.

My diet isn't optimal either which I need to sort but I'd like to understand the fundamentals of 8-12-8 to start with but I'm unsure of the following:

1) Should I be picking a weight that I know I can do 3 sets of 8 reps, or should I be picking a weight where I know for the first set at least I can reach 8? I'm guessing it's the former but I'd like to double check.

2) Should I be aiming for 12, 8, 8 or 12, 12, 12 before moving up?

2) If 12, 8, 8 is the pattern to aim for, should I still be applying almost to failure for sets 2 and 3 if I feel I have an extra rep in the tank? If I did this on set 2 for example this could jeopardize reaching 8 reps on set 3 so I'm guessing this is a bad idea

E.g. today I picked 70KG on bench press as I was confident I could maybe hit 12 on the first set, but was unsure of the subsequent 2 sets of 8.

I did the following: 70x12, 70x8, 70x6, 70x6 (aiming for 3 sets but did 4 as couldn't reach 8 reps).

I guess I'm unsure of what to do in this kind of scenario; if I can barely reach 8 in set 2, there's little chance I'll reach it in set 3. This was evident in the rest of my routine too.

Should I be lowering the weight next week to aim for 12, 8, 8, or should I raise it even knowing that I'll unlikely hit 8 reps again for each set?

My guess is that I should be picking a weight that I am confident that I can do 3x8 or 12,8,8 and only exerting maximum effort on set 1 and bumping the weight down if I can't reach the target?

I'd appreciate any advice on how to proceed

Cheers!",2022-03-21 19:39:52

[2:30 long video containing clips of my training from the start to the final OAC.](https://youtu.be/6zN1Q200RvQ)


#• Starting from Zero (4-5 months):

I started training on 23rd May, 2019, at the age of 17. At 170cm height, my weight was 44kg/97lbs. This was pretty low. I will not get into why because that's not the goal of this post. Anyway, I did not have any prior experience with strength training. I could neither do a push up or a pull up. I was so weak, that after doing a couple of negative pull ups (not even slow ones), I could not bend or fully straighten my arms for the next 4-5 days because of intense soreness. Around this time I had zero knowledge about training and I watched a lot of YouTube videos to get some ideas about what to do. You will see in the video that I used to do pull ups on my gate and rows on a broomstick, I will write more about them in the equipments section. But for the first few months, my pull up training consisted of negative pull ups (trying to go as slow as I could) and bodyweight rows, which I could only do about 6-8 reps of. I did not have a proper routine and did not know where to find one. So I just did whatever seemed logical to me after watching YT videos on this subject. 

It took me about 3-4 months to get a clean pull up and about 5-6 months to get 5.

#• The Next Phase & a New Routine (next 5-6 months)

So after about 5-6 months I found an app on Play Store called Calisthenics ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.londonsoftware.calisthenics.calisthenics ). The beginner routine was free so I started using it. Looking back, I would not call it the best thing, but it was better than what I used to do and a lot of trash routines you can find online. I followed this for the next 5-6 months. The main methods of progressive overload of this routine were increasing reps and progressively decreasing the band tension (this had a lot of band assisted pull ups). It also had a lot of isometric holds in different parts of the pull up. These were really helpful. As it got me to 10-12 pull ups in a row. But after that there was a problem. 

See the app was great for mid to low rep ranges as it's easier to go from 5-5-5 pull ups to 6-6-5 pulls on the next session than let's say 13-13-13 to 14-14-13. I do not remember the exact progression of the routine but it was similar to this. So after a certain point (10-12 pull ups), I was stuck. This routine goes up to like 19-18-18 (which I can't do even now) and after completing the whole beginner program, you should be able to do 20 pull ups in a row. But progress doesn't happen like that. I was stuck and stayed stuck in that 10-12 rep range for a long time and was not able to progress after that point. So after like 6-7 months, I decided to stop the routine and follow something of my own.

#• Equipments: 

Before I write about my routine afterwards, it's important to talk about the equipments I used. As it will be important as I introduce weighted pull ups and use different and harder progressions.

So I have never gone to a gym. In home there was no pull up bar. I first did negatives on a door ledge thing (don't know what to call that in English, but in the video I'm doing negative pull ups there). But this hurt my fingers too much. So I started doing it on the iron collapsible gate. The edge was pretty sharp so I warped 2 dirty towels around it so that it won't cut my hands. This [looked something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/7tv6MTt.jpg) This is where I did all my pull ups until I bought Rings in May 2020. I have also trained outside in a park near me. I used a broomstick and two chairs to do rows in the beginning. But it was not very stable so after a while I stopped it.

For extra weight, in the beginning I used a school bag. I had two 2.5kg/5lbs dumbbells and I picked up some bricks from the road and put it in the bag. The weight was 15kg/33lbs total (weighed using a bathroom scale). In 2021 August, I bought four 5kg/11lbs plates from amazon and a weight belt. I used five 1L bottles for microloading. Combining the bag and the plates + bottles, I could get any weight from 1kg-40kg. I used the bag to do one arm bicep curls as well. However I'm sad to say that the straps of the bag broke just few days ago while doing some weighted push ups. So I can only go upto 25kg/55lbs now, not 40kg like before. 

I have a medium resistance band. It is broken but it works. The first band I had was the light red resistance tube, which broke after a year.

Gymnastics Rings were the best investment I ever made. I hung the Rings on the gate itself (or on the bar if I was outside). The Rings were truly the game changer. I recommend buying one to everyone, even if you're not heavily into Calisthenics. Now back to the progress report.

#• Fuckaroundities (next 9-10 months):

After I was done with the app, I started following my own routine. And this was the first time I was doing weighted pull ups. I started with 5kg. The routine was very simplistics and the biggest problem was I did not have a clear idea how to progress week to week. However, being new to weighted pull ups, I did make some progress in the beginning. I went up to +15kgx3 (I only had 15kg at that time). From October-November 2020, I started going to a park at very early morning and started doing unilateral movements.

I could not carry 15kg to the park, I tried harder progressions instead. And [Mantle Chin Up](https://youtu.be/f2BM5hdX8dI) was the first progression I used. It's a very good progression. Many people who have some basic strength in pull ups want to know how to get started with one arm pull up training, and Mantle Chin/Pull Up is the answer. It won't get you to a full one arm pull up, but this will get you far. This was my main movement till about March 2021. After which I started training at home again the 2nd wave of covid hit my place. From March to August, I did a lot of fuckaroundities with different progressions and stuffs and didn't make a whole lot of progress. Then came a big change.

#• Riding the Gainz Train with APRE (next 5-6 months):

During all this time I was learning about training from different places. I spent a lot of time on Reddit, forums and websites, watching YouTube videos etc. I was also learning more about weight training theories and different programs and variables, and how they can be applied to my training. While doing this, I found the APRE mode of progression through Mathew Zlat. This was very interesting and I decided to apply it.

APRE is Autoregulating Progressive Resistance Exercise. There can be different programs based on it, this is the one I used for my weighted Ring Chin Up and weighted Ring Dip. This can be applied to any exercise.

You start with a weight you can do for 10-12 reps. You do that for 8-10 rep range. First two sets would be 8 reps (even if you can do more which you should be able to in the beginning, don't. Keep the reps in reserve). The last set you go to failure. You do it 3 times a week, and add weight every session based on how many reps you did in the last set of the last session. 

So if you do 8-8-10, you add 2.5kg/5lbs, if you do 8-8-9 then add 1.5kg/3.5lbs, if you do 8-8-8 then add 0.5kg/1lbs. If fail to do 8 reps on any set, then don't add any weight the next session. If you fail to add any weight 3 sessions in a row, do a deload and move down the rep range. 

Do the same thing with 5-8 rep range, start with the weight you ended doing your 8-10 range with. If you do 8 reps last set, add 5kg/11lbs next session. For 7, 6 and 5 reps, add weight like the last rep range (2.5kg, 1.5kg, 0.5kg). This is the range where you will make the most amount of progress. When you fail to add weight 3 sessions in a row, deload and move down again.

This time do the same thing with 3-5 range. Make the rest time slightly longer as the intensity is higher. When you can't add weight 3 sessions in a row, rest 3 days and try a one rep max. You should be a lot stronger than you used to be when you started at the 8-10 range.

This is what I used to do the program. Bought 20kg/45lbs total weight plates and used 1L and 500ML water bottles to microload and also had that 15kg bag fro before. Let's say I I need to do 28.5kg chin ups for the 5-8 range. I would have the plates (20kg) between my legs, two 2.5kg dumbbells in the bag (5kg), three 1L full bottles and one 500ML full bottle on the bag (3.5kg) and that's how I would get 28.5kg.

One of the biggest benefits of this program is the psychological one in my opinion. Because you are adding weight every session, you are basically hitting pr every session, 3 times a week. Even it's as small as 1lbs. This is very rewarding. As this is a very high frequency program, it may not work with squats and and deadlifts. But weighted pull ups/dips have excellent stimulus to fatigue ratio, so it can work. It can also work with OHP I think. Not sure about bench press. If you are not very strong, I highly highly recommend doing this program (maybe change it to 2 sessions a week rather than 3). Start from 8-10 and end at 3-5. This whole cycle should take from 6-9 months (nice). 

This got me to a 38kg weighted ring chin up (over 60% of my bw) from one rep max of 27.5kg on a bar and 3x40kg weighted ring dip (max weight I had) from 3x15kg. Then I specifically started training for the one arm chin up, from January 2022.

#• Fantastic Programs and Where to Find Them (last few months):

This is the last phase. During this time I had a pretty good idea how my body responds to different things. I tried a very unique method this time for the one arm chin up. The Concentric-Eccentric Method.

This idea was taken from Dominik Sky. Basically it is when you train the concentric and eccentric part of the movement separately. For the concentric day, you only focus on powerful concentric part of the movement. You can use a box so you don't have to do the eccentric part. Getting up as fast and powerfully you can is the goal. On the eccentric day it's the opposite. Only focus on supramaximal (something you can't do a concentric of, so higher than your one rep max) slow eccentrics. The minimum time you should spend to get down should be 6s and the ideal time should be 8-10s. I see some people do 2-3 seconds negative, I don't think it's very efficient. Does this method have any value? Is it better than traditional training? Is it sustainable? I don't know. I can just say that it worked very well with me.

I used a pulley system to do the concentric. So put one strap of a ring through a 5kg plate or a small bag with weight in it, put the strap through the ring you are not using to do the chin up and hold that strap for assistance. This way the progress is measurable and I can only get as much resistance as the counter weight allows me to. I would progressivly reduce the counter weight to make it harder. I would pull as fast as I could and would skip the eccentric. And for the eccentric day, I would jump up and do a slow one arm negative and will add weight to that progressively to make it harder. I also focused on my grip strength and bicep curls during this phase. Here's how the sessions looked like. I only did this for the OAC, not for weighted dips.

● Session 1, Monday (Concentric)

A. Pulley Assisted OAC - 2 sets of 1 (with the least counter weight), 2 sets of 2 (slightly more counter weight) - 1 set of 3 (with the most counter weight) - 5-6 min rest

B. Weighted Paused Ring Pull Ups (normal pull ups, no skipping eccentrics) - 4 sets of 5 - 3 min rest

C. One Arm Schoolbag Curl - 3-4 sets of 5 - 2 min rest (after both arms)

D. Weighted One Arm Hang - 3 sets of 10-20s - 2 min rest

● Session 2, Friday (Eccentric)

A. One Arm Chin Up Negative (with weight if possible) - 2 sets of 1 rep lasting 6-8s, 3 sets of 1 rep lasting about 10s - 6-7 min rest.

B, C, D exactly same as Monday. Only the first movement would be different. 

Here is the progression scheme. I would try to reduce 0.5kg from the counter weight every week (I used water bottles in a bag to do this) and add 0.5kg on the negative. I started with 5kg/11lbs as the counter weight and ended with an empty bottle (basically nothing). For the negatives I started with just bodyweight and ended with 7.5kg/16lbs added weight for a slow 8s negative. My best grip feat was one arm hang with 20kg/45lbs extra for 20s.

#• Conclusion:

And this is how, on 7th March, 2022, after 1019 days, I achieved a full One Arm Chin Up on both arms starting from zero. My weight is 60kg/ 130m2lbs. Pretty low, but way more than what it used to be. Let me know if you have any specific question.

Cardio for lifters (and anyone else who hates cardio),2200,tgqi27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tgqi27/cardio_for_lifters_and_anyone_else_who_hates/,444,1647568947.0,"Hey folks! I'm here to spread the Good News about cardio for lifters. TL;DR - it won't kill your gains, it *will* improve your work capacity and your ability to recover, and you can start seeing benefits from even a small amount of it done at an easy effort level. Later in this post I have an example program that only takes 20 minutes three times a week. ETA: [Here's the cheat sheet version](https://imgur.com/gallery/egnHKwC), screenshot this and you'll be on your way.

But first, the why.

## Why you shouldn't overlook cardio: science edition

First: for health. The American Heart Association, World Health Organization, and others [recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity). *Lifting does not count;* we should all do resistance training too, but it isn't included in that total.

Second: for gainz. While there's a myth that cardio kills your gains, the opposite is far more likely to be true. To quote Greg Nuckols, in the article [""Why Avoiding Cardio Could Be Holding You Back](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/avoiding-cardio-could-be-holding-you-back/)"" (a really good read, btw):

>The more powerful your aerobic energy system, the more reps you’ll be able to do with a given weight or percentage of your max, because every bit of energy you can produce aerobically is that much less that you have to produce anaerobically, which pushes off those factors that cause acute muscular fatigue. Also, if you do the same number of reps with a given amount of weight, less of the energetic contribution will come from your anaerobic energy systems, so the set will be less fatiguing. So you’re either looking at more work and the same fatigue, or the same amount of work with less fatigue; either way, you win.  
>  
>This actually relates to a past article about sex differences: Women can generally do more reps with a given percentage of their 1rm because they generally have higher aerobic and lower anaerobic capacity per pound of lean body mass than men.

and

>Your aerobic system is what produces the energy necessary to restore intracellular ATP and PCr levels, metabolize lactate, and generally get you headed back toward homeostasis so you can perform the next set. Better aerobic conditioning means you’ll recover faster between sets (and since you’ll be somewhat less reliant on your anaerobic system for each set, they’ll be less fatiguing in the first place) so you can handle higher total training volume.

So if you have a strong aerobic system, that means:

* more reps per set
* better recovery between sets
* less fatigue for a given amount of work
* you can handle more training

This means a good aerobic system directly benefits your ability to lift more. The harder you can train without tiring yourself out, the better your potential for strength and hypertrophy.

Additionally, the stronger you get, the more weight you'll need to move. The more weight you're moving, the harder your energy systems have to work. When you're deadlifting 300 pounds, your body needs to do more physical work--even if it doesn't feel that much harder--than when you used to deadlift 135. So cardio is also an investment in your future gains.

Not to mention: your performance in strength sports will benefit from having a good aerobic base, whether it's that sport's main goal or not. In strongman, static strength isn't enough to win meets; you need to be able to do things fast, with most contests requiring you to do one-minute sets (or longer) for carries, medleys, and max reps. In kettlebell sport and in crossfit, strength bleeds into strength endurance into aerobic endurance. You have to be good with all your energy systems to succeed.

Even in powerlifting and weightlifting, the better conditioned you are, the less you have to worry about tiring yourself out with warmups and early attempts. If you're a weightlifter and hate having to ""follow yourself"" (do two attempts with only a minute's rest in between), cardio is important to you too.

And even in the gym, if you don't plan to compete: who doesn't want to be able to do more work with less fatigue?

## Why you shouldn't overlook cardio: personal story time

I've been on both sides of this. I used to be a runner (albeit a slow one) who skipped strength training. More recently, I've been the stereotypical lifter who avoids cardio. But here's the thing: when I started adding some cardio back into my routine, my lifting got SO much better.

A clean and jerk triple used to leave me completely gassed. I took long rests between sets of squats or deadlifts, like, 5-10 minutes if they were getting heavy. I joked that anything over five reps was cardio, but it was also kind of true. High rep sets were torture.

But a year or two ago, I started adding some cardio into my routine, mostly with easy jogging. And last summer (2021) I took conditioning more seriously, running [Building the Monolith](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size) on top of my normal weightlifting programming. So, yes, I was running two full programs at the same time, one of which (BtM) called for cardio and conditioning as part of it. And to save time, I blasted through my BtM workouts by supersetting everything. A given workout might have 12 sets of presses, 100 band pulls, and a 20-rep squat set, plus more squats and chinups and shrugs. I made it a point to try do the whole thing in an hour or less. The cardio I had added previously benefited me here; and simply doing this much work this fast built my capacity to do even more.

I overheard my weightlifting coach telling another lifter that ""Beth can do that because she has Wolverine genetics,"" which made me laugh, because my work capacity was never like this before! Definitely not a thing I was born with.

Later that year, I [competed in a strongman meet](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUBTY63gP1g/) that included a 275-pound deadlift for reps. I did THIRTEEN reps, even though my deadlift 1rm was 315 or so. Going by the calculators (which *used* to always work for me), 275 should have been a 5RM. But I wasn't fatigued at 5 reps. I slowed down around 8. I paused at 10. I was shocked that I had time left at that point, so I did two more reps, and then I *still* had time left, so I did one more right at the buzzer. What the hell. I hadn't known I had it in me.

## But what if I hate cardio and it makes me feel like I want to die?

Good news! You don't need a lot of cardio to start seeing major improvements. The inspiration for this post was a client I worked with over the past few months. [She is a powerlifter](https://www.instagram.com/i.like.carbs/) who wanted better conditioning to improve her lifting. I gave her the most basic, minimalist cardio program, which went a little something like this:

* Monday: 20 minutes LISS (low intensity steady state cardio) on a bike
* Wednesday: 20 minutes LISS again
* Friday: a short conditioning workout, usually 10 minutes prowler pushes or bike sprints with plenty of rest in between

The first week, she said, she felt tired. By the second week, squats were feeling easier. By the end of the month, we repeated a prowler test (max distance with a given weight in 5 minutes) and her score improved from 100 yards to 160. After the second month, she was up to 200 yards.

All from three workouts each week that were never crazy hard, and never took much time. She told me afterward: ""I honestly enjoy cardio more now after starting this. I, for a long time, had the impression that you had to go borderline hard effort on cardio sessions for it to be effective. And since I lift heavy for 2 hours at a time, it was sus since I didn't want to kill all my energy in the gym.""

I knew this approach was going to work, but even *I* was surprised at how quickly she saw results with fairly easy effort. Cardio works.

## What's the minimum I need to see results?

First, the most important thing for lifters is that your cardio routine *doesn't wreck you*. Your priority is your lifting, so you need to still be able to show up to the gym and crush your workouts. While HIIT is often touted as a time saver, LISS is actually a better fit here because it has a very minimal recovery cost.

LISS is also great as a foundation because it works your aerobic energy systems. Your aerobic capabilities are the ""base"" that supports all other types of conditioning. What helps you recover between sets of lifting, or between intervals of a conditioning workout? That's right, your aerobic capacity. (For another super interesting read, check out [this case study about increasing a runner's VO2max through broadening their aerobic base](https://simplifaster.com/articles/how-trainable-is-vo2-max/).)

If you only did LISS, you'd be off to a good start. But I think it's good to include conditioning, too. This means you're doing work that ideally uses your whole body, and that isn't continuous and steady. Kettlebell swings (heavy enough to need frequent rest) and prowler pushes are some of the best options, since the recovery cost for those is pretty low. If you want to stick to cardio machines, you can do something similar with sprints on a rowing machine, bike, etc.

If you get bored of the same old bike sprints and prowler pushes, do a [Crossfit WOD](https://wodwell.com/wods/category/other-benchmarks-workouts/?feeds=none&sort=popular) or one of the HIC workouts from [Tactical Barbell II](https://www.amazon.com/Tactical-Barbell-2-Conditioning/dp/1537710443) or, if you dare, pick something from [Mythical's Book of Bad Ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pimzfr/per_request_my_free_ebook_mythical_strengths/). Just promise me you will start with something that is *short*, no more than 10 minutes your first time. When your work capacity increases, feel free to do more.

These conditioning workouts serve two purposes. One is to work the higher-intensity systems that LISS doesn't work directly; these are more aerobic than lifting, but more anaerobic than LISS.

The other is to give you a benchmark for testing. ""I feel better between sets of squats"" is subjective; ""I can push the prowler 200 yards in the same time it used to take me to cover 100"" is objective. You could also use other types of tests if you like: run a mile on a track and watch your time go down as you get better; or if you get into Peloton, do their FTP test.

## An example program you can start with

[Here is a calendar version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnRHnG37m_B5-XULRC2v0XLEvOkkjmAu/view?usp=sharing) of the program I gave my client. It's pretty minimalist, just 20 minutes three times a week, and two of those workouts are LISS, so they are meant to feel easy. It's the gentlest introduction I can think of to cardio, even if (or especially if!) you've found cardio miserable in the past.

Here's the explanation:

**LISS days** are moderate cardio. You should feel like you're breathing heavier than at rest, and probably sweating a bit. But you should *not* feel like you're dying or gasping for air. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is max effort, this should feel like a 3 or 4.

You can do any type of cardio where you can keep up that kind of effort. A stationary bike or elliptical is great; just keep up that level of effort. If you choose a treadmill or an outdoor run, you may be able to hit this effort level with a brisk walk or by alternating running and walking. Do NOT do a run-walk program like couch to 5k; it's too easy to turn that into a sprint-and-rest interval workout. You want to do your best to keep up a steady effort.

**Cardio intervals** (alternate Fridays) can be done on any of the cardio machines/modalities above. If you're on foot, you'll run for the hard parts, and walk for the easy parts. If you're on a bike, you'll pedal at a hard effort for the hard parts and pedal easy for the easy parts. The hard effort here should be as hard as you can maintain for the specified interval without wrecking yourself for the next one. Think maybe an 8/10 effort. But if you screw up and go too hard or too easy, don't give up and don't reset the clock. Just keep going and adjust your pace on the next one.

The intervals in this example are :30 hard, 1:30 easy, but you could use other interval lengths. One minute on/one minute off is another good one.

**Prowler test** (once a month) - you do NOT need a prowler to do this. You can substitute anything that is full-body hard work but where your lungs are what give out first. Other options would be HEAVY kettlebell swings, sandbag carries, or (I'm so sorry) burpees. A crossfit benchmark WOD wouldn't be a bad idea here either, so long as you feel pretty confident you can recover from it before your next lifting day.

If you're doing the prowler or one of the DIY test options, on your first test day, find an intensity where you can work hard for 20-30 seconds, need to rest for the remainder of the minute, and be ready to go again by the end of the minute. Take notes so you can repeat this test later. For example, if you used a kettlebell, write down the weight of the kettlebell. If you used a prowler, write down the weight on the prowler and measure the distance. Figuring this out will be your warmup. Rest until ready, then test yourself by setting a timer for 5 minutes and seeing how much you can do in that time.

On later test days, do the exact same thing--same kettlebell weight, same prowler loaded to the same weight--but try to beat your score (more swings of the kettlebell, more lengths on the prowler, etc).

## How to fit this into your lifting routine

The first week you do this, you may be more fatigued than usual. Be prepared for that, and maybe don't start this program the week before a meet or anything.

You can do the cardio workouts on your non-lifting days, or you can do them after lifting, whichever is more convenient for you.

Once you're used to this routine, it will be part of your baseline and you can keep it up even when you're deloading or while you're tapering for meets. The only change I would make on meet week would be skipping that week's Friday conditioning and replacing it with a LISS session or some extra rest.

## How to progress

If you’re currently doing nothing, I recommend starting off with this minimal amount of work: just 20 minutes for the LISS sessions, and no more than 10 minutes for conditioning (you can do a 5 minute warmup and cooldown for those).

After that, work toward meeting the minimum guidelines for health (150 minutes per week of moderate effort; each minute of hard effort counts double). Even brisk walks count, so adding a few of those each week will get you there.

Beyond that, progressive overload is not required. If you're happy with your conditioning, you can just keep doing the same routine forever.

If you'd like to progress, start by adding more LISS. Extend the 20-minute workouts to 25 or 30 minutes. Extend your warmup and cooldown on the conditioning days. You can even add an extra LISS day, and if you're still recovering well after a week or two, add another. You can increase the hard conditioning *slightly*, but don't try to double it or triple it right out of the gate. This stuff will leave you more fatigued than the LISS, so tread carefully, ok?

As a final note, if you add cardio (using the example program or one you design based on these guidelines) and see results, I'd love to hear how it went for you!",2022-03-18 04:02:27

Seeing Better Results on a Bro Split?,245,tg37ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tg37ua/seeing_better_results_on_a_bro_split/,126,1647496343.0,"Hello all,

For a couple of years, I have been weight training using the PPL program, where each muscle group gets stimulated twice per week. Although I've obviously seen and felt great progress over this span of time, I always felt as though I was taxing my body and hindering my recovery. I was getting stronger and more muscular, but progress was incredibly slow. My strength would stall for up to a month at times, and it would take every ounce of effort just to get that additional rep to ensure ""progressive overload."" I kept my sets at 8 per muscle group per session, totaling 16 sets for each muscle at week's end.

However, ever since I switched over to the Bro Split, I always come back into the gym feeling more than ready. To my pleasant surprise, my strength is climbing faster than ever before. I'm able to get an additional 2-3 reps per week using the same heavy weights that I'd otherwise be stalled on using PPL.This newfound and superior progress is keeping me motivated. I'm currently doing between 12-16 intense sets for each muscle group once a week.

I don't understand why the Bro Split gets so much hate. People act as if it's the worst program a lifter could utilize to better themselves. Could this be an individualistic thing?

Thanks for any input.",2022-03-17 07:52:23

Strategies For Achieving 10% Body Fat and Pushing Through a Plateau,0,tf0rpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tf0rpt/strategies_for_achieving_10_body_fat_and_pushing/,108,1647379489.0,"#  Context:

I am trying to get to 10% body fat for the first time. It's been proving pretty difficult, but one thing has more or less helped me through the entire process-- understanding caloric deficit. I've been trying to keep myself in a caloric deficit for a while now, but I've run into a problem. I'm at just under 12% bodyfat, eating roughly 1300 calories per day, and plateauing. I understand that reaching a goal such as 10% body fat requires strict dietary requirements, but from what I've seen, other people can achieve the same goal, all the while eating more calories.

I tried to look online just to get a general idea of how many calories other people were eating to reach the same milestone, only to not be able to find any numerical answer. The best I could do was brief mentions from fitness YouTubers where they would say roughly 1800\~2000 calories, which is substantially more than I am currently intaking. I am primarily interested in developing an understanding of what is *generally* normal caloric intake for those trying to reach certain body fat goals, because there seems to not be a clear consensus; I understand full well that it varies from individual to individual, so to reiterate, I'm just trying to create a range so as to establish normalcy.

It is my hope to learn and improve my own diet, and for this post to help others do so as well.

# Details on me, if you want a better picture:

* 5'8""
* Male
* 19 Years old, almost 20
* Substantial muscular development (could pass as a Marvel Hero)
* Currently at 11.9% body fat (using an electric scale)
* Between 158 and 160 lbs (fluctuates, just wanted to give a good idea)

# Typical diet consists of:

* Supplements, including: amino acid pills, fish oils for omega-3s, zinc, selenium, and multivitamin gummies (Don't judge me, I like what I like), **70 calories**
* 1/2 cup of oatmeal + scoop of protein (**25g protein**) + 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **300 calories**
* Caffeinated coffee, 1/3 cup almond milk (unsweetened) + 3 packets of Splenda, **20 calories**
* Post workout protein shake, 1 scoop protein (**25g protein**) + 1 scoop of creatine + 1 table spoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **150 calories**
* 5 ounces of chicken breast, twice a day. To be safe, I round up to 50 calories an ounce. I do this because I marinate the chicken, and use a bit of olive oil and a bit of sauce in the marinade. 50x5x2 = **500 calories, 90 grams of protein**
* Single Drumstick brand ice cream cone (I know that ice cream isn't healthy, but considering how few calories I otherwise eat in the day, I figured it was acceptable, especially considering how it helps prevent me from splurging and, consequently, backtracking). Roughly **290 calories**
* 4 cans of diet soda a day, 2 of which are caffeinated. While claiming zero calories, it is said by some that they actually have roughly 1 calorie per can, so **4 negligible calories**
* Every so often, a cup of decaf coffee as well + 1/3 cup almond milk + 3-4 Splenda packets, **20 calories**
* Grand whopping total of **1334-1354 calories per day, and 140 grams of protein**

# Exercise:

* Weightlifting 6 days a week; in the gym for about an hour each workout, so 6ish hours a week. I don't do cardio as I hear it can prevent muscle growth, and even cause muscular dystrophy, as well as increase hunger. 

# Timeline:

* I've been dieting since January, and have been lifting since February of last year. 

What am I doing wrong, that I should improve on?",2022-03-15 23:24:49

"The Odd, the Old, and the Original: The Case for Atypical Lifting",626,tagy4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tagy4l/the_odd_the_old_and_the_original_the_case_for/,242,1646858164.0,"**Introduction**: 

Today I want to talk about, and make a case for, all of the old, the odd, and the original lifts that don’t see common use in the majority of the population’s training. I find that they often garner some polarizing responses, and I want to try to convince you, the reader, to maybe give them a shot, or at very least change any negative attitude you might have towards them. I think they have quite a bit to offer and that their supposed negatives are often exaggerated or baseless. 

First, a little bit about myself and my history with atypical lifts, and then a short breakdown of what this post is going to contain before jumping into the meat. 

I do *a lot* of unusual lifts. I have for quite a while now. I’ve won a World Championship in Egolifting. I hold, to the best of my knowledge, a [World Record in the Zercher Deadlift at 550lb/250kg](https://youtu.be/ZUhlMyvvqOA). I have, again to the best of my knowledge, unofficial records for multiple USAWA lifts. I know my 1RM for [Squat](https://youtu.be/uQ3RPE2nIec), [Bench](https://youtu.be/GGETz4BZYFI) and [Dead](https://youtu.be/5Mrn8aDsvKg) performed with two barbells. I’ve [squatted my Log](https://youtu.be/pRE4i0MRwg8), [deadlifted my SSB](https://youtu.be/8pn0gb0aMxo), and [benched my Trap Bar](https://youtu.be/IvC9kNWcltE). I’ve used just about every bar I own for every lift it is not intended for and I have no intention of stopping any time soon. I don’t know how one would qualify as an ‘expert’ in this field, but I like to think I am up there. 

Here is a list of the topics I am going to cover if you choose to keep reading, along with brief descriptions. 
*Concepts and Definitions*: This section just clarifies some of the terminology and concepts I will be referring to, in order to prevent confusion. 

*The Benefits of the Odd, the Old and the Original*: This section covers what I see as the benefits of these kinds of atypical lifts, both from a subjective and an objective standpoint. 

*Arguments Against Common Criticisms*: This section offers rebuttals to the most common complaints I see about these kinds of lifts. 

*Application*: This section looks at how you can introduce this kind of lift into your training, based on how I have chosen to do so. 

With that covered we can get started. 

**Concepts and Definitions**: I start most things I write with a section outlining *my* definitions of terms and concepts. I find that it helps prevent disagreement based solely on different interpretations of specific terminology. 

*Strength*: Strength is a term that seems clear, but I think it is a lot more nuanced than most people consider it. ‘Strength’ in a general sense is multifactorial consisting of three primary components:

-Skill: The skill component represents how effective your movement pattern is in directing force produced into moving weight. This represents all technical aspects of a lift.

-Muscle size: The force production potential of a muscle is determined by its cross-sectional area. A larger muscle is a stronger muscle. Do note that this does not mean that person with larger muscles can always outlift someone with smaller muscles, as this is only one of the factors in determining strength. 

-Neurological components: This is going to be a catch all for a lot of other aspects related to your mind and nervous system. You need to develop the ability to maximally recruit your muscle fibers to produce their full force potential. This, alongside other similar factors, is the neurological component of strength. On a less directly biological side, you also need to develop the proper mindset to exert maximal effort, which I will lump in here as well. 

It should be worth noting that an individual’s anatomy (bone length/proportions, muscle insertion/origin sites, connective tissue length, etc) can impact how much they can lift. But this cannot be improved or changed so we will not focus on it. 

With these components established, I want to differentiate the ideas of ‘Specific Strength’ and ‘General Strength’ as I see them. 

*Specific Strength*: this is the strength you can express in a specific movement. It represents the sum of all three factors above and applies to lifts you have specifically trained in which the skill component is strongly represented. 

*General Strength*: this is, essentially, strength in the absence of the skill component. It’s how much strength you can leverage in a movement that is foreign to you, or a familiar movement in conditions that negate your established technical skill. 

 Next I want to quickly define the types of lifts I will be talking about:

*Odd Lifts*: These are lifts that don’t have much of an established history, and are not featured prominently in most people’s training, but are otherwise defined somewhere. The best collection of odd lifts would be the USAWA Rulebook, which features hundreds of contested lifts. Examples include a Scott Lift, Reverse Grip Press, Hip Lift, and Single Arm Bench Press. 

*Old Lifts*: Old lifts are lifts that had prominence at one point, but have mostly fallen on the wayside in modern training. Lifts like the old-time circus strongmen lifts fall into this category. The main difference between these and odd lifts is the historical aspect. Examples include Bent Press, Steinborn Squat, Two Hands Anyhow, Pullover and Press. 

*Original Lifts*: This category is anything you can imagine that isn’t really recorded anywhere else. These are purely original lifts that you come up with (even if someone has already thought to do the same lift independently). Some of my examples are Trap Bar Back Squat, Two Barbell Steinborn Squat, Vertical Trap Bar Bench Press. 

*Atypical Lifts*: These are lifts that are not trained regularly/at all. On a greater population level this includes the Odd, Old and Original Lifts listed above, but might include more/exclude some for the individual. For someone who does not train the Olympic Weightlifting movements a Snatch might be an atypical lift, while its obviously not for an Olympic Weightlifter. 

*Typical Lifts*: Lifts trained regularly, pretty much the opposite of atypical lifts. 

The last two concepts I want to quickly touch on are *building strength* versus *expressing strength*. Building strength is the process of increasing your strength potential. This does not necessarily include heavy work, or hitting PRs. It is any process that increases your strength peak potential. A hypertrophy block, seemingly ironically, is a strength building period. 

Expressing strength is simply displaying that potential. Performing a rep max is an expression of strength. The process of expressing the most strength possible usually involves processes counter to those used to build it. A peaking protocol will allow you to express more strength, but is not going to do a good job of building it. 

**The Benefits of the Odd, Old, and Original**

The benefits of these kinds of atypical lifts can be broadly categorized into subjective and objective. 

*Subjective Benefits*:

To me, these lifts are a lot more fun and interesting than the lifts I perform on a regular basis. I find joy in breaking up the monotony to challenge my strength with the old and odd lifts, and in challenging my creativity coming up with the original lifts. I am sure that this does not apply to everyone, but I think that many people have never even given these kinds of lifts a chance to see if they enjoy them as I do. They are novel, which really stands out in an activity generally featuring extreme repetition. 

Beyond personal enjoyment, they can be more enjoyable for the outside observer. The old lifts listed above have a history in circus strongmen shows, where they would be performed for the entertainment of an audience. They are fun to watch, and that has not changed even if the circus strongman has mostly ceased to be a thing. Original lifts are a form of creative expression, and while I won’t call them ‘art’ they are something that can be enjoyed by an audience. This notion seems to get attacked quite often as people ridicule the idea of lifting for an audience as ‘clout chasing’ or ‘attention seeking’. I would say “So?”. No one seems to get as upset about sharing other creative endeavors, or typical lifting achievements. What makes this any different? 

Another subjective benefit is that you are moving to a much smaller playing field if you want to be really good at something relative to the greater population of lifters. I will never deadlift 502kg to take the world record in that movement. I *can* Zercher Deadlift 250kg, however, to take that unofficial world record. The same goes for many of these lifts. I have already surpassed multiple records in the USAWA record book, and have yet to find any evidence of a higher single leg deadlift than my 405lb pull. Sure not many people choose to pursue these movements, and that makes it much easier to be the best, but that is on them. Everyone has the option to try, and I do not think it invalidates one’s accomplishments just because they choose not to. If you ever wanted to be world class in a lift, your likelihood of accomplishing that is much higher in a niche lift. 

*Objective Benefits*:

The objective benefits of atypical lifts all center around the idea that they allow you to test and develop your general strength and physical preparedness in a way that typical lifts do not. As I defined it above, general strength is your ability to move weight in the absence of significant practice. It is a function of your size, ability to generate force with that size, and bodily awareness to channel that force effectively in the absence of specific training to do so. I’m going to break this general idea down into several points. 

Atypical lifts present an excellent way to test your general strength. If you are heavily practiced in a movement pattern you are, hopefully, going to be relatively strong in it. There is nothing wrong with this. Its not ‘fake’ strength, it’s not a misrepresentation of how strong you ‘really’ are. Specificity is an excellent way to be stronger in lifts you want to be stronger in. But if you stick strictly to this specific training you lose out on strength gains on a more general level. You develop muscle memory that you rely on more than you do your general bodily awareness. If you move outside that specific movement pattern your strength declines as you lose the skill component. This can bottleneck your potential in a way. Again, I do not want to suggest that specificity has no carry over to general strength. If you hyper focus on bench press and push your numbers very high you are almost certainly going to be stronger in anything resembling a press than most people, but there will still be a drop off when you leave your practiced technique. Seeing how well you stack up in unpracticed movements compared to practiced movements that use similar muscles can help illuminate how big that gap between your specific strength and general strength is, if you care about that. 

Beyond testing your general strength, you can build it with regular introduction of atypical lifts. By challenging your body to figure out how to move loads without falling back on ingrained movement patterns you can increase your overall bodily awareness. You develop a more innate sense on how to work with weights in new and unusual movement patterns. Think of it as raising your baseline when it comes to the skill component of strength. If you develop this bodily awareness you are effectively ‘a little skilled’ in any lift you want to try. It’s important to note that the key is *atypical* lifts. If you take a niche lift and practice it regularly it is no longer an atypical lift to you. This is also totally fine, but I want to stress that the distinction between typical and atypical lifts is dependent exclusively on *your* programming, not on the lifts themselves. 

To bring personal experience into this, I have found that my ability to adapt to and learn new lifts has increased dramatically since I’ve expanded the scope of what lifts I perform. This includes niche lifts as well as more common lifts that I just never practiced. Before I introduced this variety, I would struggle with something like barbell back squat if I didn’t have a perfect set up, if my mind wasn’t focused, etc. How much I could squat would vary wildly based on external, and internal, variables. Working in a large variety of movements that could be loosely considered ‘squats’ has made me much more consistent in back squats. I can now adapt to little changes better and muscle through when I have minor technical slips. This goes for my other main lifts, as well as movement patterns that don’t have an obvious corresponding typical barbell compound. I pulled a Zercher Deadlift record on my first day trying it. I generally can manage a respectable max in a new lift with no practice.  I certainly would be better at any given one of them with extensive technical refinement, but that gap is a lot smaller than I expect it would be in most people. 

This general strength applies outside the gym as well. ‘Real’ life lifting often does not allow you to choose your circumstances and movement pattern as a gym lift does. Being accustomed to moving things in new and unusual ways is going to have substantial carryover to dealing with loads in day to day life. I work in the nuclear pharmaceutical industry. Despite not working in the department primarily concerned with the radioactivity, I often get called in to move around all the lead-lined equipment used to work safely with hot samples. I have shifted a solid lead barrel weighing over 1000lbs up off a pallet and onto a raised roller cart. That movement pattern has absolutely no corresponding lift, and I don’t know how you would recreate it, but I managed it with only moderate difficulty. Many people claim to strength train for general wellbeing and functionality in daily life. Well developing your general strength and bodily awareness with lifts you are not used to is a big part of that. 

Beyond the benefits of regularly challenging yourself with unfamiliar movements, many of the old lifts particularly offer a training stimulus that is unlike anything you will find in more conventional training. Take for instance the bent press. The ‘outward’ lateral press motion is something I have not seen in any other movement, as is the stabilization of your body in the bent and rotated position. These incredibly novel movement patterns will train your muscles and mobility in a way that nothing else will. Is this significantly beneficial in ways beyond being good at bent presses? I could not say for sure, but I do not think that expanding the range in which you are strong and capable is ever a *bad* thing. Again, note that if you choose to train something like the bent press regularly, then it is no longer an ‘atypical’ lift *for you*. It becomes a typical lift just like anything else you practice regularly.

The final benefit is somewhere between subjective and objective. Performing lifts you are not accustomed to, and are perhaps uncomfortable with, builds your mindset. It builds an immense trust in your body’s abilities, you become much more confident that your body is capable of being safe, strong, and functional in ‘compromised’ or ‘incorrect’ positions. This helps break through mental barriers in your regular lifts. If you are terrified of the risks of minor technical deviations when pushing yourself hard this will help. Its hard to be concerned that you are pushing yourself with a lift slightly outside your regular groove when you have successfully pushed yourself in movements that are a whole zip code away from any groove you’ve ever been in. Being able to push yourself when outside your ‘comfort zone’ is a valuable skill to have. If you can only functional in heavily controlled conditions you are going to leave a lot of chances to get better on the table, as life is not always going to serve you training sessions when everything goes your way. Being confident that you can adapt and perform when things go off a bit will let you capitalize on all the time that would otherwise be wasted because you could not maintain your rigid, ideal, technique. 

**Arguments Against Common Criticisms**: 

The complaint about these kinds of lifts that I see most often, probably more than every other type of complaint added together, is that they are more injurious that conventional lifts. This is bullshit born of a fear of the unknown. No movement pattern is inherently more injurious that any other, injury is born of load, not ‘form’. Your body does not have some innate proclivity to a conventional deadlift over a Zercher deadlift. It does not have a biologically ingrained set of ‘okay’ movement patterns, it makes no sense to believe that it would if you think about it for more than a few seconds. People have come to mistake ubiquity with correctness, they believe that because they see certain lifts performed all the time that they must be the right, safe and effective lifts, while things that they do not see regularly are wrong, dangerous and ineffective. This is not a valid argument. In fact, I would argue that atypical lifts are *less* likely to produce injuries if you are loading them at all responsibility. In the absence of any kind of technical practice they are going to be limited more heavily by lack of efficiency and familiarity than by lack of your bodies force production potential. To put it more simply, your body will not strain as much because the lifts will fail because you are not doing them well before they will fail because your body can’t keep up. A failure due to technical inefficiency is a lot less likely to cause an injury than a failure because your lift pushed your body too hard. 

As touched on earlier, I would go so far as to say that training atypical lifts regularly will reduce your overall chances of injury. Being more adapted to techniques and movement patterns outside those you drill regularly will reduce the chance of injury due to accidents in regular training. Having the bodily awareness to adapt to unusual loads will let your respond better when you misgroove a lift or otherwise find yourself outside your regular technique. Responding better means you are less likely to experience an injury from such events. 

A less common complaint is that they are not ‘optimal’ or even beneficial in training muscles or strength. And this is, in some cases, true. But they are not meant to be the exclusive way to train your strength and muscles, or even the predominate way. I am not here to advocate training like Joel Seedman says you should. Your entire training regime should not consist of messing around with random lifts (though even this can work if you really *really* bust your ass, it’s not a good idea for most people). They are a seasoning, a little something you sprinkle in for the benefits mentioned above. You can and probably should still base the bulk of your training around the commonplace movements. When used sparingly, they offer benefits your common lifts might not, and at little to no cost. 

Another occasional argument is that no “real [insert any kind of athlete]” uses these movements or that no trainer will recommend them. Well first off 99% of trainers are random schmucks and their words and ideas mean nothing. I don’t even deign to acknowledge that half of the argument. As for athletes, they train for a specific purpose. These lifts probably don’t benefit that purpose. Training for a sport is training with a specific actions in mind, not with a goal of a vast scope of ability. A powerlifter does not care how well they can do a lot of things, they care how much they can Bench, Squat and Deadlift for one rep. They are training for specificity. As seen in most of the rest of this write up these lifts are aimed more at developing general strength and ability, not specific strength and ability. 

**Application**:

Finally I want to talk about how I incorporate atypical lifts and what bringing odd, old and original lifts into your training might look like. 

As I said in the previous section, your training should remain largely unchanged. This is not a complete overhaul, its merely a recommendation to incorporate a few unusual lifts from time to time. I’ll mess around with an odd lift when I feel inspired to do so. Sometimes this means a lot in quick succession, sometimes it means gaps without anything. I would say they average maybe once a week. I usually perform them outside my regular training sessions, but they can also be tacked onto or replace parts of lower volume days. 

I don’t generally warm up extensively with the movement, but you could. At most I get a general warm up in then pick a weight I think will be challenging to start with. Sometimes I will overestimate and I’ll have to drop some weight, sometimes I will underestimate and keep loading weight and hitting more reps until I complete a difficult rep.  I lot of these lifts are more conducive to single reps than longer sets, so that is how I do the majority of them. I do not push to an absolute max on purpose, unless I really feel that the movement is clicking. I will fail reps sometimes, and sometimes I will load up what I think is a hard rep and it ends up being a max effort lift, but that’s not the goal. I think that this is a good effort level to push for, but if you are not very aware of your body or absolutely cannot risk an injury then you can be more conservative. 

You can also choose some of these unusual lifts to adopt into training regularly. With some of these, like the bent press, you really are not going to be remotely good at without extensive training because they are so alien compared to when you are familiar with. If you want to do this just treat them like you would any other lift. No need to do anything special because they are weird. 

Finally I will briefly talk about what goes into finding or making these kinds of lifts. As mentioned in the description the holy grail for odd lifts is probably the USAWA Rulebook. There are 300+ movements that are contested in that organization and pretty much every odd lift out there is covered in that book. Most are just slight variations on regular lifts, e.g. Reverse Grip Bench Press, but many are very much odd lifts, e.g. the Kelly Snatch. If you want to find odd lifts this is probably your number one source. 

Old lifts are mostly drawn from the old school strongmen, primarily in the late 1800s and early 1900s. There are quite a few social media accounts that talk a lot about lifting history and these can be a good place for inspiration. There are also a lot of older books on the subject, but finding these can be a pain. If nothing else just googling for circus strongman, or old school strongman will probably get you started. 

As for the original lifts those are up to you. You might be inspired because you see someone do something original, but many times you just gotta do whatever pops into your head. Here are some of the common prompts that I use when developing original lifts:

-‘What am I *not* supposed to do with this bar’: I have a pretty decent collection of bars (over 10 now) and often I will take a bar that is clearly designed for one purpose, like a Trap Bar is mostly for deadlifts, and use it for something else, like a Back Squat. This is a pretty easy formula to end up with some pretty creative lifts. Many bars are really not made to be used in certain movement patterns, so figuring out how to work around that physical constraint is a great exercise in creativity.

-‘Can I add implements’: Sometimes I see if I can’t work in multiple bars or other implements into a single lift. Having to balance and manage multiple weights can add novelty and difficulty. 

-‘Can I add asymmetry’: Most lifts are very symmetrical, adding asymmetry (using only one half of the body for a lift, or loading the implement unevenly) generally makes it easy to create something new. 

-‘That’s impossible/You can’t do that/X is dangerous’: sometimes you just need to prove someone wrong, that is also valid inspiration. 

**Conclusion**: That about wraps up everything I have to say on the topic. If you made it this far thanks for reading. If something was unclear or you want further clarification, please ask. Some of these ideas were a bit hard to articulate and I’m more than happy to better explain any parts of my position that didn’t fully make sense. I hope you will consider adding some atypical work to your training.",2022-03-09 22:36:04

The calipers I'm using are not great...but it's what I can manage to afford (maybe this is what's wrong?): [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2MIDFY](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2MIDFY)

Coach Greg uses a different approach here, but I don't have someone to measure me like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=977ZiIPP6Ko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=977ZiIPP6Ko)

**Anyway**...does anyone know why the Jackson/Pollock 3 Caliper Method is so off and what's the best method I could use to measure my bf by myself (without the help from someone else)?",2022-03-03 18:28:46

I observed same with hyper extensions of lower back, just body weight after 15-20 reps or aroujd 8-10 reps with 10-25 lbs. 

If I do foam rolling after, it loosens up by 70%. 

My question is : am I doing something wrong with these exercises or is this lower back tightness expected? 
It would be great if you could share how feel after/during squatting, deadlifting and hyperextensions.

Thanks.

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

How accurate are lift comparison websites?,23,svs1bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/svs1bq/how_accurate_are_lift_comparison_websites/,33,1645217320.0,"Hey guys, I have been using [this website](https://strengthlevel.com/) to compare myself to other lifters around the world. Don't get me wrong - I don't work out for comparison (I actually mostly do it for fun) but it is nice to see yourself moving slowly up the ranks. I also try to use it to spot areas where I am maybe lacking.

I have been wondering how accurate this website or websites like it are? For most of my lifts I solidly in the ""Novice"" category which means 6 months to 2 years of lifting according to them. This makes sense I have been lifting for 6 months and I already started out quite athletic. I am also improving at a steady rate with simple progression so I am definitely not in the intermediate stage. However, I really like lat pulldowns and can at this point do 87kg (I know that this is accurate because it can almost hold me up at 89kg bw) with 11 reps at 89kg bodyweight with really really solid form, slow eccentric and small pauses at bottom. This website says I am an advanced lifter with this exercise, which they say is 5+ years of training! I was able to do maybe 6 pullups before joining the gym. Is this because of my genetics favouring my back or should I distrust the website all together? Also, is it a problem that I my back seems to be much stronger than my front?

I know that I should first and foremost compare myself to myself, I just find this statistics stuff interesting.

Thanks.",2022-02-18 22:48:40
How to brace/breathe while using an ab wheel?,357,svloza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/svloza/how_to_bracebreathe_while_using_an_ab_wheel/,54,1645200836.0,"Bracing when squatting or deadlifting is pretty straightforward. But when using an ab wheel, bracing feels kind of weird. 

Basically, if I *don't* brace then I can really feel my abs activating or ""crunching"" as I roll back to the starting position, [like so](https://imgur.com/a/bcXdumg). By activating I mean feeling my abs flex and stretch throughout the movement. 

However, if I *do* brace before rolling out, then as I come back up it's much harder for me to feel that ""squeeze"" or activation in my abs.

So is bracing taking away the effectiveness of the exercise? Is not bracing before every rep on the ab wheel a recipe for injury? Thanks.",2022-02-18 18:13:56

Olympic Speed Skater Training program,472,stbidi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/stbidi/olympic_speed_skater_training_program/,35,1644954379.0,"Nils Göran van der Poel is a Swedish speed skater who is the current world and Olympic record holder and reigning world and Olympic champion in the 5,000 m event and the 10,000 m event.

https://www.howtoskate.se/

He's wrote a PDF about his training. Covers his mental, physical, general thinking, and specific workouts on speed skating.
I found it fascinating from a fitness perspective- it’s blue print on how he built his training program including the specifics of speed skating.

 I'm clearly not an olympic athlete, nor am I going to train like one. And I have no interesting or competence in speed skating.  
However it is a way to build an elite level training program.

I found interesting data in here and inspiration.

 * He divides his fitness training into two axes: (1) Competition speed capacity and (2) aerobic capacity.   ""The physical ability that enabled my success was a very strong aerobic base.""  He doesn’t view it as an explosive power event (which is how most speed events are viewed now). 

 * He sees the event as a series of one legged lunges and tries to train for the event by basically doing the event in an empty ring.  “     you will become good at whatever it is that you train”

 * He cycles training to enable that specific training. It’s cycled in 5-2 training (5 days on 2 off)  and seasonal cycles.  “My yearly training program was divided into three different seasons. First the Aerobic season (aerobic), secondly Threshold season (10 weeks maximal training), thirdly Specific season (3 weeks prior to event) and lastly Aerobic season 2.0.” Which is back to “lower aerobic”- kind of a deload.  

By the way his lower aerobic training is 6h biking at 220W- way past most people’s maximal training.  His maximal is way higher, however the principles at work are similar for anyone.  He explains how he does  tapering, rest and eating during each cycle.


 * Consistency and motivation was important to him- training 5 days on 2 days off. Eliminating anything that interfered with that (including travel to test VO2 max). Some variation of training program due to recovery or rest with simple metrics indicating when to rest (heart rate was a key one).


It's the best thing I've read on fitness in a while.  He posts exact training notes in the guide.

I’m definitely picking things to apply.  I’ve not done much cyclic training.  I often do 6-8 weeks of a program, plateau, switch programs.  Or 6 week program, deload and then try again.   I will be designing my training with a more cyclical training program based on the pdf, goal oriented, with simple measurables and goals. 

I do listen to my body for rest days (I’m old- rest days are mostly yoga now).  His comment:     
“If you’re listening to the body when it whispers to you, you don't have to hear it scream.”, rings true for me. 
So does the advice on the mental portion in terms of coach and media interaction- which maybe important for young athletes. 

 But the concepts from it for mental that I’m applying is creating an environment (make it easy to train) and working motivation into the training/rest cycles.

Any way- I hope you read it and get as much inspiration and information out of it as I did, even if you aren't a speed skater.",2022-02-15 21:46:19

Advice with lifting journey,183,sqgcjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/sqgcjq/advice_with_lifting_journey/,70,1644632303.0,"Hey guys. So I just wanted to get some feedback on what I’m doing well and poorly. I’m 30 and I’ve been lifting for 5+ years with some 6+ months long breaks. But the past 2 years I have been lifting (bulking and cutting) with not breaks beyond a couple months without a gym but still lifted at home. I’m pretty tired of going through building and cutting cycles so I kind of want to show a picture timeline along with my lifting routine and get some feedback. 

Couple things before. Yes I know my abs are absolute dogshit. I’ve never been able to see them. Even when I was in high school and was like 138 pounds there was nothing. But I wasn’t lifting Not sure it’s even too attainable for me or if I’d want to cut to that weight and not look as big. Idk

Chest has always been the weakest muscle group for me by far. I don’t feel it as much nearly as other muscles. I do wide grip bench, heavy dips, etc, but it’s hard to grow. 

Shoulder and mainly biceps are easily my best muscle areas. I’ve always had great arms. I’ve shown pics before and got accused of photoshopping my biceps.

That’s me at March of 2020. Sorry don’t have a shirtless pic.  173 pounds.  I haven’t worked out in 6 months. Look pretty small in a shirt. Decided to start with a strong bulk to get muscle I had lost back. 

7/2020

https://imgur.com/a/s38CuDN

3.5 months later. 180 pounds. Benching 190 and sitting dumbbell shoulder raises about 60-65 pounds each side. 

10/2020

https://imgur.com/a/oRhxlyL

3 months later. Still 180. But had to take a 2 month break from gyms being shut down but was doing home workouts with bands and smaller weights for most of this time. 

2/21

https://imgur.com/a/cUC59y6

3 months later. 188 pounds. Look a lot bigger in a t shirt. Obviously some fat as well. I’m getting compliments which is nice with good fitting shirts. Benching 210 or so. Decided to start cutting at this point. 

6/21

https://imgur.com/a/gVL3ePi

https://imgur.com/a/vH9cRDu

These are all about a month or so apart 4 months after my cut. Obviously the pics immediately post workout looks better. And shaved hair haha. Weight 164-165 pounds. 185 bench press. So I lost about 23 pounds in 16 weeks which I think is not too much or too little. Although I lost fat I’m getting told I look smaller when wearing a shirt obviously. And got weaker. Decided to cut again because was stuck at low 160s. 

2/21

https://imgur.com/a/PrnRZ2k

Fast forward 8 months. 190 pounds now. Getting compliments in a shirt. Gained 24-25 pounds in about 30 weeks. benching the most I ever have at 235. 80 dumbbell sitting shoulder presses/raises. 

Not sure what to do and what to work on or do differently. I should definitely probably cut again. I workout 4x a week. Do sets of 6-8 

Monday. shoulder/biceps. 
Military barbell press 
Dumbbell fly
Barbell front shoulder raise 
Dumbbell curl
Barbell curl

Tuesday: chest/triceps

Bench press
Incline bench
Dumbbell bench
Dips
Rope tricep pull down 
Tricep overhead press

 Wednesday: back/legs

Squats
Dumbbell back row
Bulgarian split squats
Machine back row
Calf raises 

Friday: shoulder/bis

And so on. So hit them 3x every 2 weeks. 

Bulking I eat ground turkey and rice. And I eat +500 surplus

Cutting same things but -500 surplus. 


Any advice is recommended with a new workout plan to maybe mix it up. I’m looking to get stronger but have less body fat. The whole process I did that 4 days split routine. No special routines but I would like some proven ones that have worked for guys",2022-02-12 04:18:23

"1,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day",2669,sb7tbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/sb7tbh/1000_workouts_without_a_rest_day/,386,1642982333.0,"**TLDR**

Age: 36

Years lifting: 13

Height: 5’5”

Weight: 158 to 196.

1,000 consecutive workouts without a rest day.

In this period I accomplished numerous goals. Including a [1RM Press of 235 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/). (+10 lbs. PR), a [315 lbs. 20-rep max squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/) (both at 175 lbs. bodyweight), gaining size ([about 20 lbs. of lean mass](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYfsa0hAOr-/)), and stamina (I can shovel snow literally forever). To celebrate the 1,000th day, I completed 33 rounds in a [60-minute AMRAP of a 1,000 lbs. total](https://youtu.be/_M-GCGod4RE) (345 squat, 243 bench, 412 deadlift).

**Introduction**

Hello! /u/GZCL ([Cody](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPhXX0CgmbJ/)) here. Creator of the [GZCL Method](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html) and many popular programs derived from it. A good intro to the method is linked in the [/r/Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).

For over 1,000 days I have worked out without rest days. That means no days out of the gym, and no counting steps as a workout, nor yoga, and not even shoveling snow… quickly becoming my [least favorite activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIwyZefLyL4).

All my workouts used resistance training in some way. Workouts were 99% barbell based and all but about 30 were above 10,000 feet elevation, where my gym is nestled. My training is structured by and progressed through my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework.

I accomplished these things by using a simple training framework, being consistent, and patience – the three foundational elements of progress.

**Goals**

· To see if I could.

· Assess potential for overtraining.

· Better regulate my training.

· Improve strength, size, stamina, and the condition of lingering injuries.

· To test and refine my General Gainz training framework and programs derived from it. (Read the above linked reddit post to get an idea of what that looks like.) All my personal training clients have also been lifting within this training framework.

One client has surpassed a year without a rest day. Read his fantastic write up:

[365 Days and Counting](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2021/).

**Results**

No missed workouts for 1000 consecutive days (closer to 1,050 now). Nearly all workouts consisted of lifting weights. Only one was bodyweight only (while on vacation, a fast paced, high volume, nauseating bodyweight circuit). Running, hiking, snow shoveling, etc., did not count as a workout, nor did yoga or other such activities. On many days in the winter because I live at over 10,000 feet elevation, I must shovel snow for hours. This I counted as survival, not training. Same for chopping and hauling wood in a sled. [Training is the means to survive easier.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIJuOsogabe/)

Because I was working out daily, I grew more aware of my recovery limits, thereby avoiding overtraining. This allowed me to better regulate my training as the days continued. Previously, when I was taking rest days, I counted time out of the gym as being a major aspect of recovery. That is a false notion. Because of that former belief I would go too hard in some workouts, figuring that “I would be out of the gym, and so recovering for the next session.” This was not always the case, as some workouts would go on for hours, often performing excessive amounts of sets and needlessly high intensities at all to frequent occurrences.

I had the mindset that a hard workout was always a beneficial workout and that a hard workout meant that I must be puking, shaking, or crawling out of the gym – I was wrong. A beneficial workout is one that produces a positive training stimulus while not increasing recovery debt so much that it inhibits the next workout. As I continued to train within my General Gainz framework I grew to understand this distinction and apply it consistently to my training. This improved the quality and consistency of my training. Compounding interest, but for gains.

I set personal records across rep ranges, from [1RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/B55q4pKggk3/) to 20RM, particularly for [press](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/) and [squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/). These are the two lifts that I have favored because they are less stressful on previously injured joints. Six weeks ago I hit a PR 203 lbs. [behind the neck press](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWmTgj5gZu9/) at random. It was just feeling good that day, so I went for it – an unusual decision for me lately – but old habits die hard. This lift improving shows me that my regular pressing is also, despite not currently being in an intensity directed training phase.

This was not my first bulk. But I do consider it my best. I gained 38 pounds between Day 31 and Day 1,000. Going from a low [of 158 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwItaivA_2-/) to a high of [196 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVjId0WA6KI/), with about 25 of those in 2021. I committed 2021 to a long bulk and a body building phase. The words are separated because I do not mean the sport, rather the goal of building muscle, particularly my arms and shoulders, as those were my goals.

Fat mass increased by about 5%, going from approximately 12% at 158 pounds bodyweight to 17% at 196 pounds bodyweight. This increased how much lean mass I am carrying by about 23.5 pounds (158\*.88=139, 196\*.83=162.6). ~~This means that in about 1,000 days I gained on average 1.4 pounds of muscle (and associated water weight) per month, or .35 pounds per week average. This is the biggest I have ever been.~~

~~(1000 days / 365 = 2.739 years \* 12 months = 32.868 months / 23 pounds = 1.42)~~ If my math is wrong here, let me know. I’m a pleb history major, not a king math wizard.

Math correction (I knew my math was wrong...): I gained 23 lbs of lean muscle of 32-ish months, hence about 0.7 lbs/month (or 1.4 months per lb). (Thank you /u/itsgilles )

Additionally, I achieved the goal of rehabbing a hip and shoulder that would often cause pain while lifting and during daily living.  In 2017 and 2018, before these last 1,000 days, I could not even do a bodyweight squat, or bench, or deadlift one plate without pain. That is no longer the case, as I can now squat four plates and deadlift five without those prior issues. Not my best weights for those lifts but considering what they were rebuilt from – it is great progress for me.

This was accomplished without training either of those lifts with powerlifting-esq training intensities during 2021. Likewise, despite bench pressing maybe five times in 2021, I still managed an easy [293 pound paused single](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW3ZKIsLQ69/). This lift is the one that causes my shoulder the most grief, so I have not trained it much in the last two years (a mistake discussed in the following section).

Lastly, during this period I exclusively used General Gainz as the basis for every workout. Doing so improved the concept by expanding and refining the framework. Throughout these 1,000 days it became easier to plan, execute, and assess workouts. Since I began lifting in 2008, my training evolved from random everything to percentage-based powerlifting focused, to volume, intensity, effort relationship based, with a general strength and conditioning focus. In my early powerlifting years, from “[OG GZCL](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html)” to [Jacked & Tan 2.0](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html) to [UHF](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html) and later [VDIP](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/11/volume-dependent-intensity-progression.html). The last of which grew into what became General Gainz.

**Injuries**

This section is not a prescription or advice. It is meant to describe how I improved the conditions physically ailing *me*. Consult your physician regarding your specific problems.

Do not use reddit to diagnose and treat your injuries!

During the 1,000-day period I sustained no major injuries. Only aggravating a previous tear to the right trapezius and rhomboid, and a left groin strain. Both were caused by pushing too aggressively in a single session, causing old injuries (hip and shoulder) to flare up. When this happened, I trained those areas using light resistance and high rep exercises to improve the affected muscles. I would then focus on unaffected muscles and movements, training them with more weight and/or volume.

For example, when benching caused my shoulder to stiffen or ache, I began to do more overhead pressing, a movement that did not cause such problems. Likewise for deadlift, which affected my hip more than squatting – so I squatted more.

When a movement or muscle was giving me problems, I simply ‘worked it out’ in a very literal sense. In fact, years ago I bought a specialty leg press ([Shuttle Systems MVP](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIKA3q2ALIs/)) to help rebuild my hip strength after the joint sustained multiple injuries; the worse of which were not due to lifting, but by falling (I am clumsy and unathletic).

Through exercise I was able to improve the deteriorating condition of my two problem areas, left hip and right shoulder, thereby gradually improving the lifts that tax them most. Granted, I am not at my [peak powerlifting strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvePo-WSuzg), but I have not been training for powerlifting for years now.

Where I could have done better is the bench press. Between 2012 to 2016 I had strained my right pec numerous times. This coupled with a once dislocated shoulder resulted in a total dislike of the bench by 2017, for even 135 pounds caused serious discomfort. Disheartened (as I once enjoyed the lift) I abandoned it almost completely these last three years. That I should not have done. Instead, I should have committed to regularly benching very light weights, alongside the other kinds of pressing that I had redirected towards (predominately the strict press).

Apart from those things described above I sustained no other injuries. Symptoms of overtraining, considered by some a kind of injury, were only experienced after months-long bouts of doing the same lifts daily (squat and press, later deadlift and press). Those symptoms were slight (and perhaps more psychological than physical) and came on the heels of testing High Frequency Undulating Progression (HFUP); a training program detailed in a link below. After ending the HFUP training cycle, symptoms of overtraining disappeared within days. Therefore, I do not think I had overtrained, I was just carrying more fatigue than I was used to at that time.

**Training Organization**

Workouts were built using my General Gainz training framework the entire period. From that framework, various training plans were built, tested, and improved. Training ranged from periods of high frequency and specificity, where I would do the same lift daily for a month or more (HFUP). Such periods resulted in all-time personal records for press, behind the neck press, and pause squat (linked above). Throughout 2021 I largely stuck to a body building training plan to achieve the goal of gaining size, especially to my arms and shoulders.

I have not done the same program throughout these 1,000 days, but I have stuck to the General Gainz framework, using it to construct numerous progressions to achieve various training goals. Example Training Plans:

[Generally Strong](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2019/10/): A flexible upper/lower split. (Post includes details on applications and adaptations of General Gainz; ideas to implement GG and improve your training.)

[High Frequency Undulating Progression](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/01/): (HFUP) Training the same lift(s) daily by changing the reps/sets/weights each workout.

[Wave LP](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/bw6qg0/general_gainz_wave_lp/): 4x Week Full Body. (Built by /u/ctye85) I’ve built and ran a similar progression to Wave LP.

[General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html): (GGBB) A body part split using supersets. This is the training plan I followed for most of 2021, in some form or another, as I was tinkering with what seemed to work best and changing the workouts as my recovery dictated. This means I was adjusting or changing exercises, order of exercises, volumes, and intensity, so that I could workout frequently – without training an under recovered muscle group. The linked post describes in greater detail a weekly progression outline, schedule options, exercises, supersets, etc.

With GGBB, I followed (mostly) a split of this nature:

Day 1: Legs

Day 2: Shoulders

Day 3: Back

Day 4: Arms

These were the muscle groups that were the focus in the workout. I would often do abs alongside legs or back, for example. (I did not train chest intentionally, but if that is your goal, then you can tailor GGBB to suit you.)

I would progress volume first, then once I hit a designated Rep Max (RM) target I would add weight and try to push that new weight to a higher RM. If in a workout I could not add reps to an RM set, I would do more reps in the sets that came after it.

Lift variations were used and rotated as I trained with GGBB. Such as doing SSB squat or Romanian deadlifts instead of the standard variety. Same for football bar press or incline bench. I used barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables, bands, TRX, etc.

The above linked posts detail the training plans I used during this period. Each was developed using General Gainz, which works by performing one or a combination of four actions to progress: Find/Hold/Push/Extend. Those concepts and associated progressions are also detailed in the above linked posts. (The GGBB post has a good intro to General Gainz.)

You can develop your own training plan using the GG framework. If you do, I have high confidence that you will be successful in achieving your lifting goals. GG provides a simple and intuitive organization and direction. Your consistency and patience produce the results.

My training is based in GG and so is my client’s training.

**How to Train Daily: Prioritize Recovery**

“Gains are made out of the gym” is a cliché.

One should not consider such a cliché the dominate factor in improving their physicality. People who say such things are often better at giving unsolicited advice than lifting weights.

To physically improve, it takes physical training. To consistently train, you need to recover – but that does not necessarily mean that sedentary days are required. There is nothing magical about staying out of the gym. Doing so does not guarantee an increased recovery rate.

If lifting regularly leaves you hobbled for a few days after, then you likely need more physical activity, not less. (And you also need to reassess how your training is set up. Follow a proven plan. Read the [/r/fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).)

Do more general physical preparedness (GPP) work, like snow shoveling, my favorite, not. If you don’t have snow, then just dig and fill the same hole in the dirt. If you don’t like those options, then push and pull a sled in the gym for an hour a few times per week. The point is that recovery is just as much about your work capacity as it is about your practices and habits outside the gym. None of which require staying out of the gym as a condition for success.

If you don’t want to lift weights or do manual labor daily, that’s fine. Go for walks, runs, bike – **do** something!

I have been able to recover from my workouts by prioritizing:

1.Eating and hydration.

2. Sleeping.

3. De-stressing.

People confuse not going to the gym with recovery because not doing something is easier than working on improving recovery habits. Knowing I had a workout tomorrow, I made those three things bigger priorities in my life. I was also able to better regulate my desire to absolutely crush myself, *because I have the weekend off and need to earn it*. (So I would say years ago.)

Time out of the gym is not the most important aspect of recovery. If it is for you, then you’re probably not prioritizing good recovery habits. An easy workout is better recovery than a hard night out partying, or a late night of Netflix, or a day full of stressed-out consumption of “news.”

Of the things listed above, I did the worst with eating. This has always been trouble for me, but I do think I improved a bit in this aspect these 1,000 days. Having always been a scrawny manlet, getting to 200 lbs. was my goal. I barely missed that. This is due to the many days where I forgot my lunch or was just too consumed by work to eat. I could do better here, and if I had, I know I would have had better results.

When it comes to nutrition, I have a consistent diet that is made up of rice, salad, eggs, and various meats. Often in the shape of a burrito.

I also eat a fair share of potatoes and bread but will limit those during a cut period when I am trying to lose weight. I do eat out a few times per month on average, but rarely more than once a week (if that). My most common meal is a salad with rice and beef. Since I was bulking for all of 2021, I simply increased the serving. In 2022, I’ll eat less, but typically the same kinds of foods.

Generally, my motto is: “If bulking, never be hungry. If cutting, always be.” And I try to bias my eating to the “Green Faces” practice (if it is green or had a face, eat it).

I tend to not track macros closely, nor calories. If I did, I would have had better results. 13+ years of training has developed my ability to gauge my own eating and practice good habits somewhat accurately and consistently. I could do better here, I admit.

As for hydration: I pee so often it sometimes annoys me.

Alcohol consumption is rarely more than a six pack per week. If I averaged out the number of beers drank over these 1,000 days, it would probably be one to two per week. Some weeks have more than others, especially if I find a beer I have not tried, and it turns out to be good.

I regularly get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. If I do not, then I try to squeeze in a nap. I try to nap as much as I can. One to three a week on average.

De-stressing can be hard. To do this I have tried to limit my media exposure, which I determined to be the greatest source of stress for me. Doing so has reduced worrying about things I cannot control. I admit that I could do better, and just delete every social media account and stop watching and reading any current events whatsoever – perhaps later down the road.

I have found that spiritual and philosophical practices are helpful in de-stressing and am working on improving this aspect of my life. Same for reading literature. My favorite book from last year’s reading was Hemingway’s *A Farewell to Arms*.

Regarding supplements, I infrequently consume protein powder. Perhaps 3 to 5 scoops per week. Many weeks not even that much. I try to focus on whole foods as best as I can, and supplement as may be necessary (they’re called supplements, after all). More protein powder is consumed during bulking periods for this reason, as it is easier to get in a few ounces of fluids with 30 grams of protein than it is to eat that much more beef, chicken, or fish. On reflection, I should always have an emergency shaker of protein, just in case I forget my lunch.

Additional supplements I use are creatine, vitamin D, ZMA, Arginine and Ornithine. I had (have) an unhealthy amount of caffeine daily, but I have recently switched to half-caff and have drastically reduced my energy drink consumption. I try to keep it less than 300mg daily.

At no point in these 1,000 days have I used prescription or otherwise obtained performance enhancing drugs such as hormones, SARMS, pro-hormones, or steroids. I am not a “lifetime natural.” For about one year, ending in 2016, I tried TRT. I did not find it that helpful and I could no longer justify the cost. Well before that I was a crackhead addicted to Jack3d, which was basically crystal meth… *remembers the good ol’ days* (they were, in fact, not).

**Summary**

Over 1,000 days ago I started lifting daily and have not stopped. I gained size, strength, and stamina. I have not overtrained. The condition of pre-existing injuries has improved and were only aggravated on occasion that I became a knucklehead and did more reps than I knew better to.

Additionally, I worked through my General Gainz training framework, further developing the concept, and many successful training plans in the process. Several are linked in this post. GG improved my training and my client’s training too. I hope this post improves your training similarly.

"RIP AND TEAR Program Review, and Discussion of Program Development.",771,s8rgbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/s8rgbl/rip_and_tear_program_review_and_discussion_of/,79,1642708471.0,"**Introduction**: 

This week I am finishing the last week of my 12 week program, Rip And Tear. This post is going to take a look at the program, my run of it, and then cover some general thoughts about writing programs. 

I like to start every post I write with a brief overview of the sections included in the post so that readers can know what they are getting into and skip to what the want if they don’t have the attention span to read a few pages. 

*The Results*: This section is just a brief look at the results of the 12 weeks, mostly strength focused. 

*The Program*: This section will go over the program itself, with focuses on what it contains/ is designed to accomplish, who should run it, and some of my inspirations. It will also include a link to the spreadsheet for the program. 

*My Run*: This section will look at my experience running the program, what I liked about it, what I changed, and other aspects of my 12 week run. 

*How and Why to Write a Program*: The last section will look at what goes into writing a program. Why you should or should not do it, when you should consider it, and how to go about it. 

**The Results**:
Here are some of my results from the program, which is probably the part of most interest to many of you: 

Squat: [465 x 12]( https://youtu.be/0R6zViHMR0A), [500 x 10]( https://youtu.be/r1E3OkvdVTo),  [405 x 20](https://youtu.be/I7djdphzDK8), [525 x 10 Box]( https://youtu.be/0p_ZoMgI5VM), [655lb Box]( https://youtu.be/hI4P6J2Kb3I)

Bench Press: [365 x 4]( https://youtu.be/PYy_hxCpXLw), [415 x 1]( https://youtu.be/OpG-8_e6NTY)

Deadlift: [700 x 10]( https://youtu.be/TNfy-v5d92M), [800 x 3](https://youtu.be/WYshrJyg1oM). 

Other: [805lb Deadlift 360]( https://youtu.be/_PQjjCKAqjU), [2 x 405lb Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/5Mrn8aDsvKg), [330lb Double Steinborn Squat](https://youtu.be/uQ3RPE2nIec), [365lb Single Leg Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/0zijYggfP-4), [365lb Scott Lift]( https://youtu.be/PYejvw04VTE)

Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift sets are all (or at least almost all) on program. The other lifts are side things I was able to do over the course of the program. 

I bulked for the entire period of the program but do not have specific weight numbers to share as I no longer find tracking my weight to have a purpose. I went from ~265 to ~275, give or take on both sides. 

I do not have before and after pictures, I am at a point where I could count the pounds of muscle I can expect to gain in a year on one hand, so I do not look for difference on a bulk to cut basis. [Here are some pictures from October for reference]( https://imgur.com/a/8NhJXWa). I have a strong sense of what is or is not an effective hypertrophy workout and I judge my success in that area by how many good hypertrophy workouts I can get in. I understand this is both subjective and internal, but you will have to take my word for it when I said that I was able to maintain solid and effective hypertrophy work through the 12 weeks. 

**The Program**: 

Rip And Tear is a 12 week program focused around high frequency, moderate volume, high weight Squat, Bench and Deadlift. [Here is a link to the Spreadsheet]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C4yiw7uNw1LSPlvWMDNnIlHcVQhXMzV4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104236994809501726559&rtpof=true&sd=true). Please do not ask for access to the master copy. Just make a copy for your own use. 

*Features of the program*: 

This is a 4-7 day program. It includes 3 bench days, 3 squat days, and 2 deadlift days a week. It covers programming only for these three lifts. All accessory work and the bulk of the hypertrophy work is up to the user. If you are not comfortable handling this aspect of your training yet this program is not for you. This program will also feature work for the same body parts on back to back days. If you do not have the work capacity or will to do that then this program is not for you.

The program is divided into 3 blocks that are 4 weeks each. Intensity ramps through each block then resets at the beginning of the next block. The primary mechanism of raising intensity is by an increase in weight used. This is coupled with a lowering of reps and increase in sets in most cases. Weights will reach as high as 90% of 1RM for working sets, and will go no lower than 70%. The highest rep range programmed is 7 reps, the lowest is 1. This is a program where you will be working with heavy weight. Weights are based off of a true 1RM. Do not use a training max, do not use an old PR single, pick a weight that you could confidently perform a single for at the beginning of the program. 

Every week except for the first week of each block features an AMRAP (as many reps as possible) set for each of the three lifts during the week. These AMRAPs are not used to moderate progression, progression is locked to your initial 1RM entries. These AMRAPs should be used to push yourself without fear of inflating future week’s weights. At the same time they are ultimately optional, all that is required on the final AMRAP set is the minimum reps. You are encouraged to use your best judgement and regulate yourself as needed. Keyword *needed*, not *wanted*. The final AMRAP of each block is dealers choice on weight. This is a chance for you to push for specific PRs if you so desire. 

Only 4 days a week include programmed lifts. The remaining 3 are listed as rest or hypertrophy days. How these days are used is up to you. I recommend at least 1 of these days be used for upper body hypertrophy work. Ideally a second one be used for extra work on small, quickly recovering muscles (shoulders, calves, arms, etc). I would not recommend using all three for lifting, save at least one for full rest. 3 of the programmed days include suggestions for additional hypertrophy work. You can choose to skip these if wanted, or work a different area. Again I want to stress that all accessory and hypertrophy work is *up to you*. 

*Who/What this Program is for*:

This program is designed to give you a framework for your Squat Bench and Dead (SBD) while leaving you room to still develop yourself through accessory/hypertrophy work. The high frequency on the SBD lifts and heavier weights will improve your specific strength on heavy SBD. If this is something you want, then this program might be for you. If you don’t care about heavy SBD then I hope it goes without saying but this program might not be for you. You should have a strong competency in these three lifts before attempting this program. If your technique is inconsistent or if it puts some stress on the body in an inappropriate way the high number of sets will exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to injury. **This is not a beginner program, this is not an ‘intermediate’ program**. This is program for experienced and competent lifters with a good handle on SBD.  

This program is probably best suited for periods of weight gain. You could potentially run it while cutting with appropriate moderation of your additional work but it goes against [my philosophy on cutting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I would not suggest running this program back to back. I run a program like this once a year, and will probably continue to do so for the immediate future. It is a good opportunity to improve your SBD technique, while still leaving enough room and energy for an effective bulk. But it’s a very specific kind of stimulus and if you only train in this manner you are leaving a lot on the table. 

If you want to use an appropriate substitute for any of the three lifts you can. A trap bar deadlift would be fine to swap with the barbell deadlifts. A floor press would be an appropriate swap for the bench press. A leg press would not be an appropriate substitute for the squats. Etc. This lets the program be customized for individual preferences and limitations. You do not need to lift strictly barbell SBD to powerlifting standards for this program to be effective, but again *use your best judgement on substitutions*. If you have to **ask** if something is a reasonable substitute it probably is not. 


*Where the program came from*: 

This program is most heavily inspired by Layne Norton’s PH3. I ran PH3 at the end of 2019 and 2020. I ran it as written in 2019. I ran it with [modifications]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tCi26oYp8GvT7bJuoTGDvbqy8mazemFxD02Nl4xaFRQ/edit?usp=sharing) in 2020. I wrote about my thoughts on PH3 [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/eiz8uf/program_review_ph3/). In short, I felt that it was not suitable as written for the majority of lifters. The only population I thought could effectively keep up the loads and progression were those with substantial muscle and strength, but limited experience with lower rep, high weight SBD. Basically a population that was physically equipped for big lifts but missing the specific technical skill, leading to deflated 1RMs. Granted, *this is exactly who Layne wrote the program for*, so I can’t blame him for that. But I really liked the spirit of the program and wanted to adapt it for myself and a wider population. My first set of changes brought it into line a bit, I was not nearly as beaten up at the end of that run as I was the first, but it still wasn’t quite there. It also did not click with my current philosophy on bulk programming. 

Instead of further tweaking I decided to just take the aspects that I wanted to preserve, high frequency SBD with big weights, and rebuild from the floor up. I kept the core of the program (the 3x4 week structure, the split, and the positioning of the AMRAPS) and dumped pretty much everything else. I changed the percentages, the reps and sets, and removed the AMRAP based progression scheme. I also drew inspiration from Greg Nuckols 28Free Program Builder, with the increased weight coupled with lower reps but higher sets, as I really enjoyed that set up. 

I should also credit whoever was the original author of the PH3 spreadsheet on LiftVault, as I used the bones of that spreadsheet for this one. 

I credit DOOM for the name of the program. 

**My Run**: 

*Accessory/Hypertrophy*: 
I ran 2 additional hypertrophy days, one Upper-body and one Arm day on Days 7 and 4 respectively, with Day 2 as a full rest day. I initially took days from John Meadows Gamma Bomb for hypertrophy but quickly just started performing them how I wanted, using the GB workouts as inspiration only. 

On programmed days my additional work would look something like this: 2-3 sets of 2-5 movements, usually super-setted or giant-setted. I performed some arm work on Day 1, Leg work on Day 4, and Upper body on Day 5. I performed a more intensive Leg day on day 6. I did not keep movements consistent week to week, I performed whatever I was feeling like each day. 

*Changes, Choices, and Modifications:*
-I started with 585/405/785 S/B/D 1RMs.

-I cut the programmed squats on Day 6 pretty quickly. They did not really mesh well with how I wanted to run the rest of my hypertrophy leg days and hypertrophy took the priority over a bit if extra technical practice. 

-I skipped the deads on Day 1 as needed. Sometimes my back was just too fatigued for my heavy forward lean low bar and deadlifts back to back. I do not really need the technical practice on deadlifts, and saw little value in forcing uncomfortable clunky reps. 

-I took AMRAP sets either to PR or attempted PR, or to the minimum. I reasoned that if I was not in good enough shape to push for my best I was better off controlling my fatigue so I could keep up my hypertrophy work. 

-At one point I tweaked a knee on failing an off program lift. I skipped one sessions worth of squat and dead, then used block squats to just above parallel for the remainder of the program. 

-After the 415lb bench PR I felt a small pinch between my pec and my shoulder at the bottom of heavier bench reps. I subbed in floor presses from this point onwards. 

(I want to note that both of these injuries were basically gone in ~2 weeks and had a total impact of making me use some variations. Stop being terrified of injuries folks. Shit happens when you are trying hard). 

-I did a *lot* of off program nonsense over the 12 weeks. This seems to have a pretty minimal negative impact on my training. 

*Additional Notes and Thoughts*: 
During this bulk I consumed ~6,000 calories a day. I cut out my 5k rows the first week due to a head cold and never reintroduced them. I walked 6 miles with my dog most days, with that being reduced 3 miles or 0 miles on very cold days as I realized that I was barely gaining weight regardless of all the food, so there was little reason to try and expend more energy. 

Days 1, 3 and 5 I lifted in my basement. Days 4, 6, and 7 I lifted at the gym. I lift from ~9-11am, some days taking less some days taking more. 

I felt that every day’s programmed weights were challenging, but doable. Even on a bad day I could complete my reps if I put my mind to it. On the original program, near the end there was stuff I just could not do. Even during the first week where I had some very stuffy sinuses and a very dry throat I managed, including the first squat PR listed above. 

I think that I did betray my bulk philosophy a bit. My goals should have been primarily on the hypertrophy work, making sure that I left energy for these sets every day. But there were many instances where I had the potential to set a squat or deadlift PR and taking that set took the edge of my subsequent work. All the nonsense work also probably did not help. But ultimately I *wanted* do these things and that is what matters. 

I was very happy with how well box squats and floor presses, two movements I had never done before, slotted in when I needed them. The longer I workout the more I find that no specific movement is really needed and that expanding your horizons to try new variants and movement patterns ultimately pays off into similar lifts. I used to throw myself against barbell squat, bench and deadlift, terrified of any back slide. I kept the same training style and focused on the same accessory movements. This culminated in my least productive training year plus, where my SBD total increased 15lbs, or maybe even 10lbs with an arbitrary chip of a squat PR. It sucked, I was not excited to lift, I was not progressing, I worried that I was just done getting better. Then I sucked it up and tried a totally different type of program. I was forced to make more changes to how I worked out by the pandemic. I started trying other variants and goofing around with nonsense lifts. I took breaks from focusing on barbell SBD and it massively paid off. Since that plateau I have added almost 200lbs to my total and am confident I have room to grow on all three of the lifts. I realize I have gone on a bit of a tangent here but I think it is a valuable perspective. No matter what your goals are, or what you think that they are right now, a wider scope of training style, movement selection and programming methodology will help you. It’s good for your original goals, lets you experience new things you didn’t know that you liked and helps with training longevity, both physically and mentally. [I expand on these ideas a bit here, to plug some more reading.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I don’t think anything needs to be changed before I run it next year, which I still plan to do. I am comfortable changing things as necessary, which means I can adapt to my needs in the moment anyways. Seeing as this program is directed to experienced lifters, I think that if you run it you can probably make changes within reason as well. Just take ownership, if you want to change something make sure you are confident about it. If you aren’t, you probably should not be modifying your programming. 

**How and Why to Write a Program**: 

This last section I want to cover some of my thoughts on writing your own programming. A lot of people *want* to do their own programming, but I do not think most of them *should*. If you are in the category of people who can successfully manage it, I’ll give some general ideas on it. 
My first outing in writing my own programming was the plateau year I described above. I ran something I wrote for over a year and I ended up with jack shit to show for it.
 I had just finished almost three years of random bro split into nSuns 531 into nSuns CAP3, and I felt that I had outpaced both programs, but did not want to shift to something totally different. So I took a very loose understanding of 531BBB, and hit it with a hammer until it was a pile of scrap that covered 6 days a week. I did not know what I was doing, why I was doing it, and I had only every experienced one flavor of programming. Turns out that 531BBB is not meant to be a 6 day program. Doing 531 sets + 5x10 + accessories 6 times a week, doubling up on SBD and cutting out OHP is not a good programming decision. 
But I was not going to let that stop me, I was going to run that ship fully aground over the course of a year and wonder why I was not getting anywhere. I cannot stress enough that I did not know what I was doing and that I had zero business writing a program after only three years of training and in only one style. *Do not be like me*. This is not me telling you that I am special and can write programs and you are not so you can’t. This is me explaining my own personal failings in that endeavor so that you might understand why it might not be a good idea for you. 

So what has changed between then and now? Well now I have another 4ish years of experience with a variety of programs, including my failed program. I have a much firmer grasp of what does and does not work for me, and what my training philosophies are. I have much more nuanced ideas of what my goals are and how I can reach them. I am thinking in programming blocks, not in just in perpetual consistent training. I am much more experienced and have a much greater knowledge of how things work, and how they don’t work. The only thing that can give you the above is time under, over, around or otherwise in the vicinity the bar or other heavy object. I do not believe you can effectively ‘study’ these things from a theoretical perspective, particularly when it comes to you as an individual. 

What is the best way to accumulate this experience? Train with a large variety of someone else’s programs. Try to pick programs that are radically different, or at very least from different people in different disciplines. Even as I tell you this there are plenty of areas I have not looked into yet. Even if you want to be like me and run programs that generally gravitate around SBD, you should at least run a lot of different SBD based programs in order to broaden your perspectives on how to train these movements. No two experienced coaches are going to have the same outlook, and by experiencing their programming you gain the benefit of their unique approach to training. As you gather this firsthand experience, pay attention to what you like and don’t like. What works for you and what does not. These are the aspects you are going to want to take, or leave, in your future programming. 

So now you have run at least 10 different programs, you’ve been at this for quite a few years and have a pretty solid grasp on how you operate, and *you have results to show for it*. Are you ready to write a program? Maybe. *Should you?* Well that is a totally different answer. Ask yourself these questions: 

*”Why are you writing a program”*: The answer probably should not be ‘Because I just want to’. I can’t stop you if this is your only reason, but it’s not really a good one. There are people better at this than you, and they are offering up their programs. You will almost certainly be better off just picking one that aligns with your needs and using that. A better answer to this question is ‘Because nothing I have found quite meets my current needs’. Now you are getting somewhere. Generic programs are just that, generic. This does not mean that they are bad, but it means that they are meeting relatively broad needs so as to apply to a wide audience. A custom program does not need to do this, it can focus on as narrow and obscure a goal as you want it to. It can be tailored to your needs and wants. Why did I write Rip and Tear? Because I wanted to run PH3 again, but PH3 was not really compatible with me. No other program that I knew of had the parts of PH3 that I wanted but with more compatibility. 

*”Can you just modify an existing program”*: As a follow-up, if you have a unique need, can you fulfill it by just taking a program and making some minor changes? As far as I am concerned there is no shame in working off someone’s programming homework and changing it just enough that the teacher does not notice. This was my first step, as mentioned above. I tried modifying PH3 before writing Rip and Tear and still didn’t quite get it where I wanted it. 
*”What is your program going to do, and how”*: Even if you have identified that no program can meet your needs, with or without modification, you still need to be able to explain to yourself how your proposed program will meet those needs. How are you going to structure your program so that it helps you reach your goals? What is is going to look like, in broad strokes, and why are those strokes going to lead towards your success? If you can’t explain why your program will work, it probably isn’t going to do so. In my case this was an easy question to answer. I wanted to lifted heavy SBD a lot. So all my program had to do was contain a lot of heavy SBD sets. If your goal is more specific or based on an actual result, you might have a harder time with this question.

*”What are you basing your program on?”*: I don’t think that anyone should just sit down with a blank piece of paper and completely create a brand new program from scratch. The experience you are leveraging to write this program came from other programs. *Use those*. Take chunks of other programs shamelessly. Nothing is original, even if you do make up everything in your program it’s still going to end up copying parts of someone’s programming. Don’t make more work for yourself, work with the enormous body if existing programming. As I have also mentioned above I drew from both PH3 and 28Free when writing Rip and Tear. 

*”What are you going to call your program”*: All the good programs have cool names based on cool shit like superheros, heavy metal, giant robots, or puns. If you are going to write a program you have to name it something suitably intense to properly represent how powerful it is. I named my program Rip And Tear [because it’s intense]( https://youtu.be/NgAm664NloA) [as shit]( https://youtu.be/zZMg9ryeWOw). 
If you have established that you can make a program, should make a program, and know what’s going into it, here are a few final thoughts:

-Everything does not need to have to have a precise reasoning. I just picked percentages because they looked reasonable. I picked 2.5% jumps because it seemed like a good number. Why did I up the jump to 5% for the 3rd week? I accidently typed it that way in week three and decided that it looked alright to me. This was all totally fine because the precise percentages don’t really matter that much. A little lower and I would probably just get higher AMRAPs and have more juice for accessories. A little  higher and it would be the opposite. Neither is a big deal. 

-Along similar lines you should have a good sense of what your program is going to do, and a reasonable sense of how it’s going to do that, but the precise mechanisms aren’t super relevant. You don’t need to stress over having a double undulating bilateral progression scheme or a reverse pyramid step back looping progression, or whatever the influencers pretending to be eggheads are talking about. Is the program moving generally forward in some manner? That’s probably good enough. You should know several progression schemes that you like from the experiences you gathered. Just pick one. Adding specific movements to your program? Just pick some, I promise the choice between a banded floor press versus a chained block press wont make or break your programming. Focus on the large scale, not the small scale. Your foundation matters, what color you paint the walls does not.  

-Don’t be afraid to audible. If you realize a third of the way in that something is not working change it. You aren’t going ‘off program’, you wrote the damn thing, you are *editing* it. If you have the experience necessary to write a program you have the experience necessary to make judgement calls to change things mid-program. Frankly the later requires less experience than the former. 

**Conclusions**:

I think I have covered everything I wanted to here. Again this is clocking in at north of 4k words so thank you for reading this far if you did. I will answer any questions in the comments to the best of my abilities. I am planning to work through a radically different custom program in the spring and will hopefully work out a similar writeup when I complete that.",2022-01-20 21:54:31

Diet Tracking And Disordered Eating: Which Comes First? (Stronger By Science),121,s6skf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/s6skf8/diet_tracking_and_disordered_eating_which_comes/,64,1642493962.0,"Article: [https://www.strongerbyscience.com/diet-tracking/](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/diet-tracking/)

A common concern is that quantitatively tracking dietary intake may give rise to disordered eating. A new randomized controlled trial casts doubt on this idea, fueling optimism for people who want to more actively manage their diet without unintended consequences.

**Key Points:**

1. In the presently reviewed study[^(1)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34427188/), 200 female college students who did not closely monitor their diet were randomly assigned to one month of diet tracking with MyFitnessPal or no intervention (control).
2. The researchers did not observe significant negative effects on eating disorder risk, anxiety, depressive symptoms, body satisfaction, quality of life, eating behaviors, physical activity, screen time, or other forms of weight-related self-monitoring. 
3. For individuals without a current or previous eating disorder diagnosis, tracking with a diet app did not negatively impact psychological outcomes or increase eating disorder risk. On the other hand, the mere act of tracking did not significantly improve other health-related behaviors.",2022-01-18 10:19:22

When do you return to exercising after Covid?,568,s2acw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/s2acw0/when_do_you_return_to_exercising_after_covid/,295,1642005004.0,"Hi Reddit, it’s 10th day after I was tested with Covid (yeah, got it on New Year) with mild symptoms. I still have some coughing but otherwise feel much better.

Before it, I was training with different levels of effort for around 2 years and strictly followed bodyweight RR for last 2 months with good progression (from my point of view).

My question is when and how to resume working out. I think it may be an interesting discussion especially with this new variant as a lot of people either already went through this or will go soon. 

Some sources [1] tell that you need to wait at least 10-14 days after all symptoms are gone, but it sounds too harsh to me. Others [2,3] suggest for at least a week (also after all symptoms are gone). But again, minor coughing usually persist pretty long after Covid and I’m not sure if you should wait after it’s completely gone or a week after fever is gone is enough. 

I desperately want to resume these fun activities but afraid of making things worse to me. So, want to know if anyone has some experience/knowledge in returning to fitness after the illnesses. And what is the general rule of thumb of the community (I’m not seeking for a medical advice, just want to discuss with the people here their experience and issues in returning to fitness)

Build ‘Real-World Strength’ With Uneven Load Weight Training,11,rv29nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rv29nx/build_realworld_strength_with_uneven_load_weight/,56,1641218209.0,"Hey guys!

I came across a really interesting article and I am wondering if someone has done this type of training before, or what some people's thoughts are. 


To try to condense the article, it suggests using different weights to create uneven loads. It gives this example. ""When selecting your weights for off-balance weight training, start by making sure the heavier side has 5 to 10 pounds less than normal for unsupported movements (meaning not laying on the ground or on a bench). Then subtract another 5 to 10 pounds for the other side. For example, if your Walking Dumbbell Lunge is normally performed with 40-pound dumbbells in each hand, I’d start with a 30-pound dumbbell in one hand and a 20 or 25-pound dumbbell in the other hand. Then, and this is crucial, you want to make sure you perform an equal number of reps with the dumbbells swapped. So if you start with the heavier dumbbell in your right hand and the lighter dumbbell in your left hand, you need to ensure you’re performing an equal number of reps with the heavier dumbbell in your left hand and the lighter dumbbell in your right hand"". 

The justification for this type of training is that in the real world we dont deal with perfectly balanced weights, so training this way helps us in a more practical sense. It also discusses stabilizing muscles. 

Anyways, I'm interested in playing around with this type of training, but just wanted to see if someone has done this before and/or what are some people's thoughts. 

Here is a link to the article if you're curious.

New to r/Fitness? CLICK HERE FIRST!,1475,rv4o9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rv4o9f/new_to_rfitness_click_here_first/,0,1641224973.0,"# Welcome to r/Fitness - Reddit's #1 Health and Fitness community!

r/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.  We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.

To help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.

# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded, and this year we are asking for your help to make it community funded.

Domain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.  **If you'd like to contribute**, you can anonymously donate any amount via [an Amazon e-gift card](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU) to [purplespengler@gmail.com](mailto:purplespengler@gmail.com).  Donations will be closed once the hosting fees are reached, and we thank you for your consideration.

# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!

* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.
* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.
* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.
* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by ""it depends.""  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.

As mentioned, this is my first post here, so I’ll just jump right in to it and explain.

I (male, 20’s) do a lot of different activities (mostly running, cycling, skating on ice, crossfit. High intensity is Key), but recently i’ve lost interest in doing these kind of activities alone. In fact, I think its straight up boring just having to do these things by myself. I want to share my training experience with somebody, talk about the training session, and so on. 
Its just about having someone interested in the same kind of things as me. If i want to do a hike in the mountains, i usually have to prepare myself that its just going to be me.

I have a girlfriend, but she doesn’t want to be involved in these high intensity training sessions. With her, i usually just walk. I also have some friends that I ask if want to join me, but they never want to.

I’m not even an extreme kind of training guy, i’m just average and want to be in physical activity. When I first started training, i didn’t care about being alone. But Now i think about training as some kind of experience, rather than some kind of personal goal. 

I dont how to solve this. 

QUESTIONS: Do any of you struggle with the same?How do you manage to exercise alone? 

I’d love to have your take on this.",2022-01-03 00:55:37

I looked all over for a spreadsheet of a (free) program Paul Carter outlined some years ago but couldn't find one, so I made one! I'm not very good at google sheets/excel so if you have any tips feel free to let me know. I've included the article Paul wrote and the link to the google sheet that you can make a copy of to edit yourself.

I found the article's tips very helpful and having run the program through once a year ago I got my OHP up to 135. I'm going to run it again soon and try to get up to 175.

How to New Years Resolution - Stronger by Science podcast discusses goal setting and behavior change,767,rt5khd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rt5khd/how_to_new_years_resolution_stronger_by_science/,42,1640991709.0,"**Tl;dr - For maximum success, create a hierarchy of goals and approach them with good vibes.**

[LINK TO EPISODE](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)

New! 1/3/21 - [Link to accompanying article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/goal-setting/)

Tis the season for New Year's Resolutions (NYRs), and [the most recent Stronger by Science podcast](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)  came through with evidence based tips on how to best set fitness goals.  And before you dismiss January 1 as insignificant or primed for failure, SBS shares that rates of success for NYRs aren't that bad.  Six months into the year 69% of people in one study were claiming success, and 55% were still claiming it after 12 months.  ^(19:50)  Additionally, the ""fresh start effect"" that the new year offers is real and able to be leveraged. ^(24:00)

So what does the science say about setting ourselves up for success with NYRs or any other goal?  Establish a hierarchy of goals that all support each other.  ^(30:50)

* Start with a **SUPERORDINATE** goal. Have a big, value- or identity-based goal as an anchor that will provide your ""why.""  It should explain why all your smaller goals matter and act as a motivating force.
* Next have **INTERMEDIATE** goals.  These will be a little less vague and give you a clear route to accomplishing your big goal while still allowing flexibility in the path you take to get there.
* Finally, have **SUBORDINATE** goals.  This is where your SMART goals live for all of you trembling in anticipation of seeing your favorite acronym.  Your subordinate goals set up what you're going to do, how you'll do it, and when it will get done.  These are the goals you interact with on a daily basis.  Because you've set your Intermediate and Superordinate goals, these can be adjusted as needed to find any of the many routes to success.

You've got your hierarchy.  What's next?  SBS reviews what the evidence says will help you meet those goals.

* Identify your specific obstacles, and set your intermediate and subordinate goals to target them.  ^(49:50)  Set an if/then plan for when you will implement behaviors that lead to your goals.  ^(1:23:53)
* Plan not only your actions but your coping when things go wrong.  Challenges will always arise, and you can think through how you'll address them ahead of time.  ^(1:29:20)
* Utilize approach goals instead of avoidant goals.  ""I will eat more vegetables"" instead ""I will not have candy.""  Approach goals are associated with positive emotions and greater well-being, and the evidence supports it's a more successful route to take.  ^(52:50)
* Pair a delayed gratification behavior with something enjoyable in the moment.  For example, listen to your favorite true crime podcast only while you're out for a walk.  This ""temptation bundling"" adds an incentive for your goal based behavior.  ^(1:25:30)
* Piggyback new habits onto ones already established.  ^(1:28:17) 
* Allow yourself flexibility both with diet ^(1:03:34) and other behaviors.  Having some ""slack with a cost"" leads to increased persistence. ^(1:18:00)

One common theme that ran through the goal setting and the achievement strategies was this - NO BAD VIBES.  Setting goals properly and with things you can control will help you succeed.  There is no need for shame or the idea that failure or setbacks are a personal failing. ^(51:30)  Good vibe approaches work.

One Rep Max Questions,25,rriv51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rriv51/one_rep_max_questions/,48,1640812302.0,"Hey all!

I have some very limited experience in lifting; I have followed programs sporadically and worked with a trainer for a month here and there but I would say I'm effectively still a beginner.

The program I've just started is based on %ages of ORM. The trainer I was working with previously actually recommended it.

My question is when and how I should calculate ORM. I have a squat cage at home as well as an Olympic bar and dumbbells, but I don't have anyone to lift with and am kind of nervous to try maxing out myself. I also feel like until I have someone there for safety I won't go to max. I need to get ORM for most of the major Barbell/Dumbbell exercises. I'm also not sure if the dumbbells I have will go high enough for me to max out (30 per hand max).

My questions are:

1. Do I do it on a normal workout day? Should I do it on a rest day and count that as my accessory/cardio work?
2. Is there a safe way to do it alone with safety bars, etc? Or should I just schedule a time with a friend who can spot. Would it be better to get into an actual gym for this process?
3. How often should I try to update this/repeat the process? I'm sure over time its going to change.
4. How should I handle ORM for exercises that don't use weights (band, bodyweight like dips, etc)?
5. What are the other ways people determine workload? Seems like there are a lot of different ideas/programs out there. I think its not so tough to determine which exercises to do but how do you know when you've worked enough or too much?

In any case, I am going to be sticking with this program to completion before I start looking into 5. 

Thanks everyone!",2021-12-29 23:11:42
What Is the Best Method of Cardio for Fat Burning?,979,rrdk8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rrdk8z/what_is_the_best_method_of_cardio_for_fat_burning/,420,1640799066.0,"#[Link to Article](http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/blog/what-is-the-best-method-of-cardio-for-fat-burning/)

In this blog post from Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, he summarizes a recent meta-analysis his team performed comparing HIIT and moderate intensity exercise on fat loss:

[Slow and Steady, or Hard and Fast? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Studies Comparing Body Composition Changes between Interval Training and Moderate Intensity Continuous Training](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/9/11/155/htm)

He notes a previous meta-analysis came to a different conclusion but has since been retracted after several oddities were found.  (Which, as an aside, [seems to be a thing](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/17/exercise-researcher-earns-more-retractions-as-investigations-mount/) plaguing Brazilian research lately.)  

The new paper is open source and worth a read, but Brad sums it up nicely by saying:

>Take-home: We can confidently state that HIIT cannot be considered a “magic bullet” for fat loss; MICT is equally as effective for achieving this outcome.

Still, the data is not without its limitations and Brad does a good job laying those out and further explaining how different protocols may lead to different results.  Then concluding with a message I don't think can be repeated enough:

>Research can help to guide exercise prescription, but ultimately you must determine the best course of action based on individual needs, abilities, and goals.",2021-12-29 19:31:06

Sled push to increase speed and acceleration,33,rr3l0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rr3l0g/sled_push_to_increase_speed_and_acceleration/,17,1640767664.0,"Hey all! For reference, I am a squash player. The length of the ""track"" is 10meters so every 10m i need to turn the sled around. So one ""round"" is 10m

I have been experimenting for 3 weeks with the sled push. Since I train legs 3x a week, that means a total of 9 sessions with it. Trying out different weights, distance and rest periods. My primary goal is to increase accelaration and my secondary goal is to increase leg endurance, espeicially for squash. My experience with it, I love it. It feels great and I think it is a decent exercise combining regular squats, box jumps and lunges. 

My problem is that Im not sure how to program this movement. I have thought it through and I think I can do 2 heavy days and one lighter day. The heavy days being two rounds of max effort, and the lighter days would be a bit longer perhaps 6-10rounds. The heavy days having the goal of increasing acceleration and the lighter day more of an endurance builder.  If you ask why I chose those distances, yes I pulled them out from my ass. 

So my question is, do  you program this on max distance covered in a x amount of time, or a predetermined distance fastest as possible? If you think the former, then for how many minutes if the goal is acceleration and for how many minutes for endurance? And if you think the latter, then how far should the distance on the heavy days and on the lighter days. 

Follow up questions, should i also include reverse sled pulls? Like instead of pushing, you go backwards.


Tl;dr: how to program sled push

Edit 2: After reading the comments I will adding the sled push to build leg endurance and not speed. I will be cheking the sprint subreddit for that",2021-12-29 10:47:44

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

CrossFit & Strength Accessory Program,18,rmdei8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rmdei8/crossfit_strength_accessory_program/,32,1640203195.0,"Hi all!

Just looking for a bit of advice really.

I’ve been off and on with gyms for the past few years and then when covid hit, really got back into going to the gym again, messy breakup, big focus on myself!

My new partner is really into CrossFit, so I thought I would give it a go, and fell in love aswell. My main concern about a standard gym was me not actually taking the time and effort to do any cardio, having asthma I was always scared too, but doing this has pushed me out of my comfort zone.

Anyway, the coaches have great WODs programmed in and do to Oly session on the weekends. But I really miss doing some good old strength training to go alongside it. I was doing a PPL at the time, but the CrossFit gym doesn’t have all the same equipment so I thought I would just focus mainly on the CrossFit and metcon. 

Now I want to get my strength back to similar/better level so I’ve been looking at strength programs again, but I don’t want to spend hours in the gym as each class with the warm up is roughly 45/60 mins. 

Can anyone help or may if had a similar situation in the past and what they did to have CF and a strength program side by side? I was looking at simple 5/3/1 but wasn’t too sure if it was enough.

Thanks all!


TLDR- I’m looking for a strength program  (5/3/1-PPL - just on a faster scale)to go side by side with programmed CrossFit workouts.",2021-12-22 21:59:55
"Lost 18,8kg(41,5lbs) in my first 6 months, here's what I did.",1430,rmces7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rmces7/lost_188kg415lbs_in_my_first_6_months_heres_what/,242,1640200353.0,"24 years male, 1,87m(6'1) went from 87,3kg(192,5 lbs) to 68,5kg(151lbs) in 6 months.

[Progress pic/TDEE estimate/Weight Loss Graph](https://imgur.com/a/i2K3eSO)

**Diet:**

Calories:

Setted the goal of losing 0,9% bodyweight per week, eated the calories that would cause this given the amount of exercise I was doing, check TDEE estimate to see calories and weight variation.

Macros:

Sticked to 2,2-2,8g/kg/day of protein cause of the satiety benefits instead of the 1,6-2,2 range.

For fats I stayed near 0,5g/kg/day and minimizing saturated fats, and the rest I completed with carbs and sometimes alcohol.

I weighted myself every morning right after waking up and using the bathroom, only supplements I took were creatine monohydrate and a big cup of coffe before workouts.

**Exercise:**

Routine:

I sticked with Push-Legs-Pull since I went to the gym 6 times a week. Chose my exercises based on the concept of SFR(stimulus to fatigue ratio) since those were my first 6 months in the gym the first 2 were more experimentation and seeing what worked best for me but from there I sticked with those:

PUSH:

1. CHEST PRESS
2. SHOULDER PRESS
3. INCLINE DUMBELL BENCH PRESS
4. MACHINE ASSISTED DIP
5. CABLE TRICEPS PUSHDOWN
6. HANGING LEG RAISES

LEGS:

1. LEG PRESS
2. DUMBELL STIFF LEG DEADLIFT
3. THIGH ABDUCTOR
4. SUMO SQUAT
5. LEG EXTENSION
6. CALF PRESS
7. AB CRUNCH MACHINE

PULL:

1. MACHINE ASSISTED PULL UP
2. SEATED MACHINE ROW
3. UPRIGHT ROW
4. BARBELL CURL
5. MACHINE BICEP CURL
6. TWISTING SIT UP

I did 2 Mesocycles with a deload in the middle of them (it's the green week on TDEE estimate) for sets and reps I started lightly at 2 sets each exercise and 3 Reps in reserve in first week of the meso and increased it to 5 sets each exercise and 0 Reps in reserve in the last week of the meso. At the first 3 days of the week I focused on progressing load and in the last 3 days of the week I focused progressing reps, that made me stay in the 8-12 rep range for the first 3 days and 10-20 rep range for the last 3 days.

This part was really auto regulated I didn't increase every exercise to 5 sets I just increased the volume enough to give me greats pumps, burn in high reps sets, tension in low rep sets and recovering fast enough to not be sore on the next day I trained that same muscle group and ofc started relatively light and made it unsustainably hard in the last week.

Alright, I imagine that all of the above are pretty usual things that most of folks probably do, now I also done two other things that I think helped me a lot!

First: I made use of 2 days Refeeds based on a study that saw greater muscle retention, I putted those on Thursday and Friday to get the beginning of high rep half of the week and since on Sunday I rested it made possible to increase volume while still being able to recover properly.

Second: Only cardio I did was taking steps, A LOT of steps. Steps are really inefficient from a time pov but when you factor the fatigue it generates its really small you can burn so much calories without hurting NEAT or training that is completely broken. I started by taking 10000 steps daily but ramped it up to 20000 steps near the end of the diet. You can check on TDEE that I was eating 2150kcal and still losing tons of weight in the end cause of the high volume training and high step count.

I read the following books to help me guide the methodology I used:

1. Art of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
2. Science of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
3. Fat Loss Forever - Layne Norton
4. The Pyramid of Muscle - Eric Helms
5. Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy - Brad Schoenfeld

Next on my list are the Renaissance Periodization books since Dr. Mike Israetel seems an amazing author.

Thanks for reading if you made it to here! My future plan now its to maintain and deload for the next 2 weeks and start a mass gaining phase at the rate of 0,5% bodyweight per week for 6 months while lifting heavy.",2021-12-22 21:12:33

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out.

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

**Many of the readers here in r/fitness are firmly in this category. Learn how to lift, and then move on as soon as you can.**    
  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)**  Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many readers here are in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up.",2021-12-20 15:06:01

I'm specifically wondering if you think tonal can be used to build muscle since it's method of resistance is different from free weights and more similar to cables or resistance bands. 

The features seem pretty cool, specifically the chains and eccentric mode which apply add and reduce weight as during concentric and eccentric phases of the reps which I felt were better than free weights.

Personally, I doubt that it's worth the money since there are cheaper home gym alternatives but if tonal were to get cheaper in the next few years, do you think the level of convenience it provides may be worth the money?",2021-12-16 01:56:50

These threads are for users who have had success in overcoming a specific kind of fitness challenge to share their experience with the community (as one might share tales around a campfire) of what worked for them, answer related questions, and start a dialogue with fellow members of the community.

[Our last series of campfires](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9vmln4/announcing_rfitness_community_campfires/) produced an invaluable [repository of information](https://thefitness.wiki/resources/community-campfires/) that is still used by new and old members facing the same challenges. For this series we'll ask some new questions and revisit old ones, all with the hope that they help someone stay the course or make progress toward their fitness goals.  (See the most recent one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r4skys/community_campfire_fitness_gift_ideas/).)

We'll continue by revisiting [a previous campfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a70bp4/community_campfire_keeping_on_track_during_the/) given that gatherings and celebrations have changed a bit in the years since.

# This Week's Topic: Keeping On Track During the Holidays

 This topic will be for those who have been able to keep their pursuit of dietary and exercise goals on track when faced with some of the conflicts of the holidays - disruption of your routine, prying relatives, an abundance of food and alcohol, scheduling conflicts, and so on. What actions have you taken that have worked?  What mindset shifts have helped? 

​

**Here are the rules for Community Campfires:**

* Top level comments must share the details of something that worked for you to overcome the challenge / solve the problem of the topic and have some effort put into them. Comments that are asking for advice or only talking about what *didn't* work will be removed. Comments that are off topic will be removed.
* Replies to top level comments should be a question for the commentor about the experience that they shared. Comments that are simply thanking them, starting an argument, or asking for personalized advice will be removed. Express thanks and dislike with votes, not comments.
* Comments should be predominantly serious. Comments that consist solely or primarily of a joke will be removed.
* Comments should be civil and follow the [Principle of Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
* Any attempt at advertising or self promotion of any kind will result in a permanent ban.

When participating in a Community Campfire thread, remember the theme - A group of people with the same goals sitting around a campfire sharing their experience for the benefit of everyone listening.",2021-12-13 16:11:26

I am a police officer and want to join our **police** elite tactical unit, EKO Cobra. Theses guys are REALLY good.

**First of all, I don't want tips for passing the test. I already can accomplish the required physical limits.**

**This topic is about a** **police special unit. So no endless marches and sleeping in cold mud for days. Nevertheless it's really tough and I want to prepare myself optimal for the tasks.**

**Obviously, I'd be happy if you aren't a member of a special unit but have good knowledge too and answer ;-)**

**1. FYI Wiki**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EKO\_Cobra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EKO_Cobra)

**2. FYI Video**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b\_0T4EdbRl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_0T4EdbRl8)

**3. Training contents**

""marksmanship, tactical training, sports, driver courses, abseiling/rappelling, hand-to-hand combat, language classes, etc. Besides the courses taught in the basic training, further specialization is possible in fields, such as parachuting, diving, explosives, or sniping""

**4.** **Tasks**

Anti-terror, personal security for politicians and diplomats, hostage-situation, risky arrests of dangerous criminals, ...

**5. My stats**  
I'm a 6'0 ft (185 cm) tall guy and weigh between 187 and 210 lbs (85 kg - 95 kg), depending on my current focus in training. I trained for strength for a few years and then I just climbed a lot.

Started training with weights two months ago. Doing 2x upper and 2x lower body per week, with focus on basic movements (bench, squat, row, deadlift, press, pull-up, lunge). Especially upper body strength stats are increasing well again and quick at the moment.

**My current strength stats are:**

* Pull-Ups: 13 x BW
* Bench Press: 220 lbs x 10 reps
* Military Press: 145 lbs x 10 reps
* Deadlift: 330 lbs x 10 reps
* Squats: 242 lbs x 10 reps

**Running stats:**

* 1,86 miles / 3.000 m in 12:05 min
* 6,2 miles / 10.000 m in 45:36 min

**My questions**

I am curious how you guys (if you're members of such a unit) train for being fit optimal on duty. You have to be good at just everything. Muscle endurance, strength, anaerobic cardio, aerobic cardio, ....

* How often do you guys hit the weights in the gym?
* Which routine do you train?
* How do your stats look like?
* How often do you do cardio? After leg day it's hard for me to absolve a hard running workout.
* In what unit do you serve?

Thanks in advance.",2021-12-09 09:28:32

How effective is walking?,1169,rai2v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rai2v5/how_effective_is_walking/,692,1638825668.0,"I have never seen anybody except for obese people talk about walking as exercise on Reddit.

I'm sure other forms of exercise are better for you (running would benefit you in cardio better, and lifting would benefit you in muscle tone better). But surely walking is much better than sitting on the couch.

What physical benefits does walking give you, and what distances are required to achieve any noticeable benefits?

And what are the differences, in terms of physical benefits, between different kinds of walking (pavement vs. rough, flat terrain vs. hiking up a mountain)?

The Problem with 'Form': Exploring 'Forms' Place and Use in Lifting.,781,ra8yrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ra8yrm/the_problem_with_form_exploring_forms_place_and/,170,1638802213.0,"**Preface**: 

This post is going to present a series of ideas on how to approach ‘form’ as a concept in lifting and it’s application. These ideas represent the thoughts and opinions on the subject that I have built over almost a decade of lifting [heavy things](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWN6v-0gSv-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) with [form](https://youtu.be/8E-iMybhQUo) that has been called [questionable](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWvYzWQgGzL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), going so far as to even win a [World Championship]( https://www.instagram.com/reel/CW_MAuRJ0YT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) in lifting unusually and in an excessive manner. That said almost everything I am going to talk about here is theoretical/conceptual, and it is what *I* think. I am not presenting facts, nor am I suggesting that anything here should become a fact. The goal is to present a viewpoint that is outside of the common understanding of form, with the hopes that you, the reader, will refine your own views on the topic. If you are convinced and agree with everything I say great, if you agree with some and move your views to something in between cool, if you think about what I am saying here and reject all of it that is okay too. The only thing I want here is to make you think more deeply about something that most people just write off as a simple and obvious topic. 

 I know that many people feel strongly about the importance of form when lifting, so I ask you to please read what I am writing and give the ideas presented a fair shake before running to the comment section to tell me how wrong I am. I intend to write this in a manner that it can be understood and processed by anyone, I will not be including complex anatomical jargon or links to dense studies that most people are not equipped to work with, and I will do my best to explain every term I am using and explain any relevant background information. That said if I am unclear in anything please feel free to ask for clarification. 

Like I did in my last post, I am going to give a short breakdown of what I will be writing about then I will get into it. 

**What Form is, and how it differs from Technique**: The first section will define ‘Form’, its counterpart ‘Technique’, and explain the differences. This is an important distinction to make both in terms of the rest of the post, and in thinking about ‘Form’ in general. 

**Why there is no such thing as ‘Perfect Form’**: The second section will look at why there is no such thing as a universal form/technique, and why individual variables, training purpose, and other factors can all influence the form/technique used. 

**Form and Injury**: The third section will cover the relationship between form and injury risk, and present an argument for thinking about injury risk as a function of load, not form. 

**Practical DOs and DON’Ts**: The final section will tie the previous ideas together into some applicable DO’s and DON’Ts.

With that out of the way lets get into the meat of the post.
___________________________________________________________________________
**What is Form, and what is Technique?**: 

The very first thing we need to do to discuss form is define what it is and is not. Form, by formal, general definition, is ‘the *visible* shape or configuration of something’. This definition applies to form in the context of lifting as well. Form is the *visible appearance of a lift, as seen by an outside observer*. This seems obvious, but this definition is important when separating form from technique. 

Technique, conversely, encompasses everything you do, consciously or unconsciously, when executing a lift. Every action you take, whether you think about it or not, to move a weight from point A to point B is part of technique. Technique is what you should be pushing to refine and improve on. Improved technique is ultimate goal, not improved *form*. 

So how does technique differ from form? The distinction sits in the ‘visible’ part of the definition. **Form is the external, visual, manifestation of technique.** Now I am well aware that this *sounds* like a pedantic distinction without merit but I think that it is very important. You cannot see every part of technique. You cannot actually see the interplay between muscle groups or the activation of each individual fiber, you cannot see the thought processes that go into activating the these muscles, you cannot see resulting forces on the weight and every bone, muscle, and joint in the body. What you *can* see is the results of those things in the way they move the body and the weight, and that is ‘form’. With form you can only *approximate* what is going on in terms of technique. 

Form is one of the few tools available to look at someone’s technique as an outside observer, but it’s limitation’s must be understood and respected. You must understand that when reviewing form you are observing a portion of the *results* from a set of actions, and then you are extrapolating what actions must have occurred to create those results. Form can never give a perfect insight into someone’s technique. With enough viewpoints and the right experience to interpret them you can get a pretty solid understanding of the technique involved but it’s still ultimately an indirect assay and thus imperfect. 

It is even more difficult to work with form in most practical settings. Unless the lifter is wearing extremely tight clothing, or no clothing at all, visual information is going to be obscured by clothing hanging in the way. Unless you are walking in circles around the lifter, viewing multiple sets from every angle you are not getting a full 360-degree view of the lift. Online it is even worse, you are getting a single (usually questionable) angle with which to view the lift in the form of a video. Not only is there an inherent disconnect between visual form and physical technique, but you are often working with an incomplete visual. This makes the final approximation even worse. 

Before moving on I want to look at a practical example to really hammer the point in: 

Picture someone deadlifting, who has some back rounding under their loose gym shirt. You can see the ‘form’ (a back that is rounded to some degree) but what can you say about the technique? Are they a beginner who is struggling to maintain a braced position and is being bent over by the weight? Or are they more experienced, purposefully maintaining that torso position while fully braced in order to effectively start from a higher position? One form, two potential technical causes. One is ineffective and should probably be corrected if the lifter wants to move more weight, the other is fine. You can use other clues to help inform that decision: how much is the lifter pulling? Do they have a level of musculature that suggests they are experienced? Is the back static or actively rounding? With this context you can make a solid assumption about technique, but the form of ‘rounded back’ does not inherently tell you what their technique is, nor if it is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. 

__________________________________________________________________________
**The Problem with ‘Perfect Form’**:

I am going to start by outright saying that perfect form does not exist. It cannot be achieved, it should not be a goal, and you should never try to impose it on yourself or another lifter. There are multiple reasons why this is true, and I will break them down in this section. 

***Form is not a goal***: The first point ties into the something I mentioned in the last section, and that is that *technique* should be where your focus lies, not the resulting form. With some exceptions for when form dictates what a lift is, or it’s competitive standards, the way your lift looks does not matter in the slightest. Yes, a competition squat in powerlifting needs to include your hip crease dipping below your knee line, but how the rest of the lift looks Does Not Matter. Effective technique does generally result in a certain spectrum of visual forms but outliers exist and putting the effort into making a lift look a certain way is getting the technique-form relationship backwards. **You should be trying form changes to see if they improves your technique, not changing your technique to see if it makes your form look better. **. Form is one tool for communicating and implementing technical changes, but that is it, it is not something that you should change your technique for because it has inherent value. If form is not something that you are trying to directly achieve there can be no reason to try and ‘perfect’ it. One could argue that *technique* could be perfected, but I would disagree there too. 

***We are not made equal***: Human anatomy has a high degree of variance. We are not built equally so it stands to reason that we should not lift equally either. Telling a 6’5’’ lifter with long limbs to perform a squat in the exact same manner as a 5’2’’ lifter with very short limbs is ridiculous. Limb to torso proportions, femur to total leg proportion, muscle insertions and origins (where a muscle is attached to bone), joint angles, and uncountable other variables all impact the specifics of a lifters most effective squat technique. In addition to the anatomy one is born with past injuries, personal preference, equipment choice, and other non-anatomical variables will further impact the specifics of a lifter’s technique. No two people should be lifting the exact same way, so there cannot be a universal ‘perfect’ technique.  

***How you should perform a lift depends on your goals***: Because we are all different, there is no universally perfect technique for a given movement, but *even an individual does not have a singular, personal, perfect technique*. A lifter can use the same general movement pattern for multiple purposes, and what those purposes are is going to impact the technique used. A bench press performed to move the most weight possible is not going to be performed in the same way as a bench press performed focused on building up the chest, or a bench press performed to develop a certain aspect of the technical execution. Which of these is the ‘right’ technique, which is ‘perfect’? None of them are. I guess you could go further and say that each goal for each individual has its own ‘perfect technique’ but at a certain point you are really going past the concept of ‘perfect’ by providing a rationale to call anything perfect.

*We are not machines*: We are incapable of executing a lift in the exact same manner over and over again. Even if there was a ‘perfect’ we could not reliably achieve it. It would be a fruitless endeavor to chase it. Instead we should look at what is a good, or even acceptable, *range* for our lifts. Deviation from the ideal is fine, technique that is just shy of the best still works just fine. Taking this approach not only gives a much more reasonable standard for your reps, but acknowledges that you are imperfect, that you will be fatigued sometimes, that your mind will wander a bit on some sets, and that you will phone it in sometimes. All of that is completely fine provided you stay within the acceptable range for technical execution, and program with that range in mind. Perfect is the enemy of good enough, so choose good enough. Time spent working hard with technique that is good enough will build more strength, size and experience than spending that same time trying to calculate or reach your notion of perfection.
_________________________________________________________________________________
**Form and Injury**: 

I’m going to start this section with another bold statement: no technique, or form, is inherently more dangerous or more liable to injure you than any other. I know this flies in the face of a lot of common opinion on the topic I request that you stick with me for a second. Injury in lifting can, outside of freak accidents or other odd cases, generally be attributed to improper load management, not improper ‘form’.

 Load refers to how much you are lifting, for any given rep or over time. Load management is the process of choosing appropriate weights for your sets, both long and short term. Any movement, with any technique, has a threshold for how much you can effectively lift with it, and exceeding that threshold results in an increased risk of injury. This failure to manage load can be acute, loading up more than you can effectively move for a single rep, or chronic, performing too many reps at a given load over a period of time without allowing time for sufficient recovery. These two are not completely independent, you can be pushing your long term load management a bit too far and open yourself up to an acute event that would not have been as issue if you had been more rested for example. The threshold is also not static, as mentioned above you have a ‘range’ of technique and you have a corresponding range of load thresholds, depending on how on the ball you are for any given rep/set. 

Now how does this tie into technique and form? Technique, and the resulting form, that is generally considered to be ‘dangerous’ is just less effective, and thus has a lower load threshold. Lets go back to the example of a deadlift with back rounding, in this case born of an inability to properly brace the torso and not a conscious decision to get better positioning. This is something that is generally considered dangerous, with the implication that lifting like this will injure you. That’s false. It’s not an inherently dangerous movement pattern, its just ineffective and you cannot lift very much with it before you cross the load management threshold to increase injury risk. If you don’t believe that lets do a quick mental exercise. Could you safely deadlift a pool noodle with an unbraced back? How about a 1 inch steel pipe? An unloaded barbell? 135lbs? You had to have answered yes to at least the pool noodle question, and probably some of the others. You already accept that you can safely pick up a trivial weight with this ‘dangerous’ form, so you accept that the variable responsible for injury is the weight used, not the technique. Obviously you should try to use the more effective technique, so you can safely lift more weight, but you are not going to have an excessive risk of hurting yourself using *any* technique, provided you lift within your ability for that movement. 

Now why does this matter? Isn’t it just pedantry? No. Understanding the actual cause of injury in this situation teaches several important lessons that can and should impact your training decisions:

**You need to manage your load**: Even with the best technique you can muster you are still at risk of injury if you lift too much. Good technique and form will not protect you against injury if you are pushing excessive loads and volume. This is usually obvious from the acute standpoint, it is pretty intuitive that trying to lift a lot more than you are capable of is going to chance an injury. The problem of chronic load management is less obvious. You can lift sub-maximally, with solid technique, and still open yourself to injury if you are trying to hit too many hard sets a session/week/month/other time period. Your body gets fatigued with every rep and that lowers its performance. You can’t hit your 1RM over and over again, and you probably can’t go balls to the wall on your sets in some movement 3x a week for months on end. Good programs will manage this but a lot of lifters, even experienced individuals, will push themselves too hard. It’s very tempting to keep up momentum when you are setting back to back PRs for example, but that is not a sustainable trajectory, even with your best ‘form’.

**You are probably not going injure yourself just because your technique is lacking**: The second important thing to realize from this injury model is that *any* movement can be performed with reasonable expectation of safety if you manage your load properly. I see a lot of beginners that are paralyzed by a fear of progression with sub-optimal ‘form’. They believe that they will sustain a severe injury out of nowhere at some point if they do not correct how they lift. While freak incidents can occur, this is not a reasonable fear. Even if your technique is sub-par, if you gradually add weight in a responsible manner you can keep progressing even terrible and inefficient form safely. I believe that this is a good thing in most scenarios. You are going to be more likely to adapt your technique and discover more efficient movement patterns if you are pushing yourself. Your body does not ‘want’ to move the weight in an inefficient manner, if you keep making it lift weights it will slowly find a better way to do it. You will change some little thing on each set and eventually something will click and you will find the weight moving better. If you refuse to keep slowly progressing weight out of fear of your imperfect technique you will not experience this stimulus to adapt. 


**Most serious injuries do not come without warning signs**: Of the two kinds of load management error, chronic and acute, chronic is going to be much more prevalent if you are lifting even remotely responsibly. When you have a chronic load management issue you are not going to be feeling great then suddenly develop an injury. It is a gradual process that almost always comes with some warning signs. If you are lifting too much with your bent back deadlifts, to go back to the last example, you are unlikely to suddenly develop a major lower back injury, you will experience discomfort, additional strain while lifting, or some other precursor before the injury occurs. You can use these warning signs to take proper steps to manage the issue. Accepting that you have these warning signs should open up what you are willing to try. If you are unsure about a technical change, or if something needs to be changed, you can keep working with it if nothing feels off. 

That said, you cannot always see a large injury coming, there is some inherent risk in pushing yourself with any technique. You can’t always see mild or moderate injuries/pain coming, as they can be the warning sign that something bigger might be on the way. You also may not be able to directly assess what is causing your pain in every scenario, sometimes the cause is unclear or unintuitive. You should not be paralyzed by the fear or injury or let it hold you back, but be cognizant it can happen, and that it probably will if you push yourself hard for long enough. You need to strike a middle ground between excessive fear of injury and complete disregard. Despite this, lifting is still one of the safest form of physical exercise in terms of incidence of injury/time spent, so keep that in mind. 

**You can train anything**: Outside of accusations that certain ‘form’ is dangerous on common movement I see a lot of people fully writing off all kinds of movement patterns as inherently dangerous, such as behind the neck presses or pulls. They are not. You can train *anything* with a reasonable expectation of safety provided you start at an appropriate weight and build your way up at an acceptable rate. You might discover at a low weight that a movement does not agree with you, or you might not hit a wall and find that you can build up to heavy weights in these atypical movements. Either way it’s *safe* to explore these movements if you do it properly, because *the technique and form are not inherently dangerous*. Just remember that you have little idea of your threshold with a new movement or technique, so start with conservative loads. 

**If it works, it works**: The final point I want to make is particularly aimed at newer lifters that are watching advanced lifters with unusual execution. I see a lot of people with no appreciable experience telling people lifting very serious weights that they are doing it wrong and are going to injure themselves. This is extremely misguided, and arrogant in my opinion. If someone has cultivated their personal technique to the point where they can lift such an impressive amount of weight do you not think that they have worked out a technique that is compatible with their body? Do you think they accidently managed to lift a weight that less than 1% of lifters could manage by doing everything incorrectly? No, if it works for them it works for them. Their load threshold with that odd technique is high enough to manage the weight, and probably higher than their threshold for a more conventional technique. It probably won’t work well for most people, but it works fine for them. They are not going to hurt *themselves* just because you would hurt *yourself* using a comparable technique. You are different people, with different bodies. To expand this idea, if you find yourself effectively and comfortably moving weight with a technique that is unusual, and ineffective for most other people, don’t try to change it just because it is not normal. It’s working for you, keep exploring it until it does not work for you then change whatever is not working at that point. Don’t try to fix something that is already working.  
____________________________________________________________________________
**Putting it all Together, Do’s and Don’ts**: 

This last section is going to bring all the ideas covered in the previous sections into some actionable Do’s and Don’ts when it comes to using ‘form’ to influence your training decisions and the advice you give to others. 

***DO use form as a source of potential changes for your technique***: I want to start this section by stating that form *does* have a place in making technical changes to your lift. It is very hard, if not impossible, to describe how you should change your lifting technique without framing it as form change. ‘Bring your stance closer’, ‘Try to start with your hips higher’, ‘Break at the hips before the knees’, ‘Touch lower on your chest’ are all examples of form advice that can produce beneficial change in a lifters technique. The SUPER IMPORTANT CAVEAT to this advice is that it is not absolute, everyone is going to lift a little, or a lot, differently. 
Not all lifters will use the most common stances for their lifts, not all lifters should be touching a bench press down at the same spot. It is definetely worth it for newer lifters and those experiencing a plateau in progress to explore this kind of advice, provided it’s coming from an experienced source. But if it does not improve your lift after you have given yourself time to adapt to it you should ditch it. There are no universal truths when it comes to form, and advice is only good and ‘correct’ if it is helpful. 

***DON’T cram yourself into a box and chase an idealized ‘form’***: I’ve said it already, but I really want to stress that form is a *means to an end*, not a goal in of itself. The point of trying to produce a specific form is to cultivate better *technique*. Chasing a specific form, and changing your technique to reach that, is backwards and counterproductive. If a change makes a lift look nicer, but you lift less effectively, or with more discomfort, then it is a bad change. If you find yourself comfortably (or at least a comfortably as heavy lifting gets) lifting more weight with a technique that produces an unusual form then go with it. Looking pretty while lifting is not the goal, at least it is not the goal of strong people. 

***DO frame your form advice as a suggestion, and know when not to give it***: Form policing is a cancer in the lifting community, it really is. It just keeps spreading and it strangles out the healthy, strong viewpoints on technique. You cannot know everything about a person’s lift just from watching a video of it, or from watching it in person for that matter. For that reason you really should structure your advice as *suggestions*, not absolute rules. The goal is to get the trainee to try something differently in the hopes that they discover a technical change that helps them. It’s a tool for guidance. When you tell a new lifter that they MUST lift in a specific way you stifle that discovery and inhibit their ability to find the technique that works best for them. 
Form policing also presents as people giving unsolicited and ineffective advice to experienced lifters. Everyone has room to improve, and almost every experienced lifter realizes this and strives for it. But someone watching a video of their lift and parroting generic beginner form advice is not helping them. It’s not helping anyone. It’s arrogant and condescending.
I have tried to write this entire post in a non-combative and tone, I really do want people that might not be initially accepting of these ideas to at least give them a chance and have tried to avoid putting people on the defensive for that reason. But we are nearing the end and I need to indulge a little bit on this one point and say that if you are form policing you need to shut the fuck up. 

***DON’T cling to form standards past the beginners stage***: This is a bit of an expansion on the point about chasing idealized form above. The general form advice that is given to beginners absolutely has a place. A beginner has no technique on which to build and the only way to really create that initial technique is to present a general form that they should try to imitate. This helps them stumble through their first reps and sets in a relatively safe and moderately effective manner. But these generic beginner form guidelines are *training wheels*. They are an excellent tool for initial teaching but at some point you need to remove them and learn to ride the bike. No one has ever won a Tour De France with training wheels. Don’t cling to them too hard once you have that initial technique down and certainly don’t force them onto more experienced others.

Done with the informations, I started lifting about less than 2 months ago,  my aim is always been strength, I don’t really care as now to be cut and lean (aesthetic), I’d rather be big and bulky with some strength. Here’s my progress in the 3 main compound exercises: my bench went from 115lb 1rm to 185 1rm as now, I set my goal to bench 225 1 rep max by the end of 2021. My squats went from 185 1x4 to 225 lb 1x5 and my deadlift went from 315 1rm to 1x5 and my 1rm is 365. So the question is how is my progress?

What would make a great gift for someone with your particular sport or hobby?

&#x200B;

**Here are the rules for Community Campfires:**

* Top level comments must share the details of something that worked for you to overcome the challenge / solve the problem of the topic and have some effort put into them. Comments that are asking for advice or only talking about what *didn't* work will be removed. Comments that are off topic will be removed.
* Replies to top level comments should be a question for the commentor about the experience that they shared. Comments that are simply thanking them, starting an argument, or asking for personalized advice will be removed. Express thanks and dislike with votes, not comments.
* Comments should be predominantly serious. Comments that consist solely or primarily of a joke will be removed.
* Comments should be civil and follow the [Principle of Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
* Any attempt at advertising or self promotion of any kind will result in a permanent ban.

I ask this because many people who are interested in exercise seem to say that feeling the “burn” and really pushing yourself is really important and insinuate the benefit is far greater this way.

Advice for strength training with only one working hand?,47,r1ef54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r1ef54/advice_for_strength_training_with_only_one/,33,1637785740.0,"I'm looking for advice, ideas or experiences about strength training with one hand. Due to an injury several years ago I had my main wrist flexor tendon sheath (FCR) released surgically 3 years ago and I'm basically left with a painful right hand that flares up badly with tight gripping or flexion under load (push ups are bad news). Prior to the injury and surgery several years ago I lifted weights regularly for many years and loved it. I felt it kept me health mentally and physically. Since the injury I've lost about 30 lbs of muscle, most of my clothes are baggy now and I just dearly miss exercising. I've accepted where I'm at with the hand and I want to move forward with this new limitation. I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to get back into strength training and am looking for any ideas at all; most/all of my old basic gym lifts are not doable anymore.

I have done some looking via Google and on this subreddit, but I haven't found anything very definitive.  Thus far I have been trying some body weight exercises (mostly one legged squats, unweighted lunges and core work), Pilates, some modified yoga/DPPY yoga (I made a roughly elbow height platform that I can rest my forearms on for downward dog etc). This has been better than nothing, but I really miss lifting weights (or body weight) and strength training. I realize I'm unlikely to put on large amount of muscle with one hand, but I'd really like to recover some of my lost muscle mass and/or get that great feeling you get after a hard workout. Has anyone done strength training one handed or know of anywhere that I might find more information? It doesn't have to be classic strength training. I'm very open to any type of exercise type or program, I just miss the feeling of being tired after a good workout. Getting stronger would be a huge bonus though.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all of the input and motivation. Super helpful. I'm going to try some of this and get back in the gym and just experiment.

&#x200B;

**In short**: I can't use my right hand/wrist for tight gripping or pushing and I'm trying to do some type of physically tiring exercise, ideally strength training, but I'm open to anything tiring, and I was hoping for and ideas or input.

&#x200B;

Thanks!",2021-11-24 22:29:00

Its been a while since my last post and I thought I'd just share where I am at with lifting and give an update now that I am 6-7 years into constently training (I think my last post was at 4 years into training for reference). 

**PHOTOS:**

[Before and after photo 01](https://i.imgur.com/4TrLyBH.jpg)

[Before and after photo showing legs lol 02](https://i.imgur.com/qKAbFPh.jpeg)

**WEIGHT:**

154lb (70KG) to 169lb (76.8KG) in the photos

169lb is me probably at my leanest. Usually if I am not dieting, I sit closer to 83kg/183lb. 

Timeframe is approximately 6+ years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university. The last two years have been a bit rougher with less time in the gym and more time dedicated to other things. Progress has definitely slowed down and training volume has decreased but still a consistent part of my life. 

**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

Please note that most of these numbers were achieved at a higher bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 193lb (88kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down.

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 600lb (272.5kg)

**Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 645lb (292.5kg)

**Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 353lb (160kg)

**OHP:** 45lb (20kg) to 243lb (110kg)

**Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 474lb (215kg)

**PROGRAM**

As previously mentioned, training volume has dramatically decreased due to time constraints and life getting in the way now that I am older. I'd like to think that I am smarter with training these days and instead push each set a lot harder than I used to and make more use of it but I definitely still waste a lot of time fluffing around or chatting with friends at the gym. I am still running a Push Pull Leg Split although most weeks I will skip the second leg day for a extra rest day. I'd like to attribute this to the fact that squats have not felt great since having my ankle run over by a car when skating however I think I am just too lazy to work on the mobility etc needed to get my squat back up lol.

**Monday - Push 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x8-12 Flat Bench
* 4x8-12 Incline Dumbbell Bench
* 4x12-20 lateral raises
* 4x12-20 rear delt flies
* Tricep accessories vary

**Tuesday - Pull 01**

Example workout would be

* 10x10 body weight pull ups focusing on lats
* 4x8-12 single arm dumbbell rows
* 4x8-12 Lat pull down
* 4x8-12 chest supported row
* Bicep accessories vary

**Wednesday - Leg 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-8 squats
* 4x20 Walking Lunges
* 4x12 Leg Hamstring Curl
* 4x12 Leg Extension
* 4x12 Sissy Squats
* 4x12 Straight Leg/Romanian Deadlifts

**Thursday - Rest**

**Friday - Push 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-7 Overhead Press
* 4x12 Incline Barbell Press
* 4x12 Arnold/Shoulder press
* 4x12-20 Lateral Raises
* 4x12 Cable Flies Low to High and High to Low

**Saturday - Pull 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x4-8 Conventional Deadlifts
* 5x10 Pull ups (weighted)
* 4x8 Rowing movement
* 4x8 Lat pulldown
* Bicep accesories if there is time

**Sunday - Rest**

I still religiously do core every second day which consists of decline sit ups, dragon flags, hanging leg raises/windshield wipers.

As I mentioned, the last two years of training have not been ideal. Strength has not been a driving factor for training and I definitely could have made bigger improvements if I focused more. Unfortunately such is life and hobbies/passions cannot always be prioritized.

**COMEPETITION PREP**

Around July 2021, I decided that I needed some more motivation and that I was sick of going to the gym to just do the movements and make little to no progress. I approached my friend who competes in bodybuilding and decided that I would try my luck at a natural men's physique bodybuilding show set for mid November. 

Unfortunately one month into my competition prep my city went into Covid Lockdown and all gyms shut down (and are currently still closed). I was fortunate enough to act quickly and get a bunch of gym equipment to set up a home gym so my prep continued. However with covid spreading throughout the country, the shows looked less and less certain and the show I was intending to do has been postponed twice already. 

I decided that I would call off the competition prep three weeks ago as we are still in a lockdown and competition prep has been intruding on everyday life, work, and my relationship with my partner. 

See below photos for start of competition prep vs where I ended prep.

[Competition Prep Photos](https://i.imgur.com/clsIOMS.jpg)

**DIET**

Diet on competition prep vs everyday diet is very very different however I will list below what a typical day looked like on prep as it is a lot more structured. 

**Breakfast**

A mixture of Egg whites, Whole eggs, Protein Pancakes, Cereal, Milk, Toast, Peanut Butter, Protein Oats, and Fruit

**Lunch**

200g cooked chicken breast

200g Sweet Potato

150g steamed brocolli and beans

**Pre-Gym**

60-80g protein oats or something carby

**Dinner - Post Gym**

200g Rump Steak

400g Low Carb Potato

100g Steamed vege

Protein Shake

**Post Dinner**

200g Chicken breast

200g salad mix with balsamic vinegar dressing or something

Usually this adds up to about 2400-2600 calories depending on the day. 

When I wasn't on competition prep, things were a lot more flexible and I eat out a lot with my partner. I still meal prep weekly and make sure I eat about 60-70% of all my calories quite similar to the above competition prep diet. I generally eat between 3500-4000 calories to maintain a bodyweight of about 86kg/190lb. 

**END**

Thank you all for reading through all that lol and I also just want to thank this community for being so helpful when I first started lifting. I hope this post can help someone out there who is just starting/already into their journey. Feel free to send me a message or comment below with any questions and I will try my best to answer! 

Remember, we're all gonna make it ;)",2021-11-14 07:27:36

Boostcamp for GZCLP: An Apple and Android App.,475,qrxvqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/qrxvqf/boostcamp_for_gzclp_an_apple_and_android_app/,112,1636673006.0,"Hi Everybody!

Today I want to showcase a physical training app that is available for both [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boostcamp-training-programs/id1529354455) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpmhealth.boostcamp&hl=en_US&gl=US).

[Boostcamp.](https://www.boostcamp.app/)

First, I’ll tell you why this app has impressed me. They’re one of two developers to have contacted me and asked me about my programs before releasing them on their app. Because I have published many free training programs, there are many free options out there for apps that include them. However, not all are created equally – which is why I am impressed with Boostcamp.

In chatting with the development team, I have helped them add a GZCLP progression to Boostcamp, which has notable lifters like Greg Nuckols and Jonnie Candito on the team.

Boostcamp has many programs available, including: nSuns 5/3/1, Nuckols’ Beginner Program, PHUL, Reddit PPL, and Candito’s 6 Week, and quite a few others.

I am stoked that GZCLP has been added to their app. Even more so that the app does a good job of adding flexibility and many options to personalized GZCLP to suit your needs.

This means that when you run GZCLP on Boostcamp you will be able to:

Determine your training days by days of the week. This is also displayed in a neat calendar view that shows what days you trained on, providing easy review of your own training history. (Currently 4-days per week is supported in the beta, a 3-day schedule is in the works.)

Units and weight rounding. Supports both Freedom Units and Kilograms and allows for rounding to the smallest weight plate available. So if you have access to 1.25 lbs. micro plates, then go for it.

Update weights and reps. Meaning if you’ve made a bigger increase in weight than called for, perhaps because last week you noticed it was too easy, you can make that change on the fly.

Same goes for your reps. Last set rep outs (+ sets) are accounted for. This is a major function of how GZCLP progresses, so to have this be straightforward and easily tracked is huge.

Additional exercises can be added. Say you want to do more pressing on Day 2, you can add that – or another variety – using a convenient drop-down list. This is for your T2 and T3 exercises.

After completing a week of workouts, the app populates the next week for you.

After a workout you can provide a rating and feedback, noting what went right, wrong, or otherwise.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Boostcamp also provides community support! There’s a chatroom for the individual program where you can help others also running the program and get help from those same people.

Additionally, should you want to support the program creator, such as yours truly (or perhaps Greg Nuckols, or Jonnie Candito), you can! I am thankful for every donation I get from you all via PayPal, which is linked in my blog, but that Boostcamp provides this option for those content creators is greatly appreciated. In my opinion, it is important simply for recognizing the work of those that created the training programs, who without the app would not be as good!

Please check out Boostcamp, especially if you’re running a 4-day version of GZCLP. I am sure it will help you streamline your progress and make easier the tracking of your training history.

Have a fantastic day,

Cody (GZCL)",2021-11-12 01:23:26

Good ways to calm down after exercising? Lately I've been feeling stressed after.,135,qmdq9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/qmdq9v/good_ways_to_calm_down_after_exercising_lately/,99,1636003816.0,"I've seen a few posts about this but not too many answers. I'm a generally happy, calm person, not depressed but a bit prone to anxiety. I've noticed that over the last few years, exercise has gradually made me feel more anxious afterwards. Especially cardio (running or dance) or anything strenuous (like heavy weights), but even with more easy going workouts (yoga or a hike), I'll feel it. It seems to trigger an adrenaline or cortisol response, which lasts for a whiiiile. It makes sense to me, I think my body just assumes we're running from a tiger and it triggers a fight, flight or freeze response. My body feels stressed out after, for at least a few hours, if not the rest of the day, and I feel like my brain goes a bit fuzzy.

I feel fantastic when I'm exercising, just not so hot after, and it's really putting me off exercising at all. If I don't exercise, I feel happy and calm throughout the day. I try to make sure I'm eating a good diet, whole foods and enough calories. I don't eat sugar really, or take any stimulants. It doesn't seem to be common, but I see a few people on here share the same problem.

Things I've tried:  
Cooling down slowly  
Trying to not raise my heart rate too high  
Breathing exercises to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system afterwards

If anyone has had this problem and found a solution, I'd love to hear it. Or ideas from anyone else! If you've made it this far, thanks!!

[End Physique](https://imgur.com/a/8NhJXWa)

Now that I hopefully have earned a bit of your attention here is a rough breakdown of what you are getting into:

**Definitions and Concepts**: It’s not exciting but I want to start off by introducing my specific definitions for some terminology, as well as some overarching ideas that form the framework of what I am presenting. I hope that by covering this from the outset the whole post will make more sense and we can avoid silly arguments based on semantic differences and misunderstandings 

**Why you should pursue Strength Goals while Cutting**: This section will go into why I think that you should entertain the notion that cutting does not need to be a period of stagnation, and why you should be pushing for strength goals during this period rather than in periods of weight gain/bulking. 

**How to Structure Training under this Philosophy**: This section will cover some ideas on how to apply the ideas presented in the former section when building your long term training regimens. 

**A Detailed Look at my recent Cut**: Finally I will go into details on what I did on my most recent cut to give an example of the suggestions discussed in the previous section in action. 

Finally I want to add a note here before we start on who is an appropriate audience for this post. This information is ultimately aimed at more advanced lifters. This does not mean that I think the information contained is worthless for beginners or intermediates, but realize that some conditions and assumptions will not apply fully or at all to you. I encourage you to think about the ideas I present, either to pull select parts for your own use or just as something to stick in the back of your mind for when you are lifting at a higher level. This post is also aimed at general lifters who want the best of all worlds when it comes to strength, size, etc. If you are competing in a specific sport and what to dive fully into the aspects you compete in this might not fully apply to you. With that aside let’s start.
_____________________________________________________________________

**DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS**:

The first thing we need to get out of the way is what a cut is and what a bulk is in this context, and what the goals of each are.

 I am assuming here that a cut is a period of caloric deficit in which you are trying to maintain muscle mass while losing fat to a reasonable level. You are not trying to gain mass in any way while cutting, and you are not cutting to obscenely low body fat percentage. I won’t put a firm number on obscenely low but if you are trying to prep for bodybuilding competition or reach a similar level of leanness that is not a cut *in the context of this post*. 

I am assuming here that a bulk is a period of caloric surplus in which you are trying to build muscle mass. The amount of fat you do or do not gain is not really relevant, but I would expect you are gaining *some*. I want to reiterate that this is the only inherent goal of a bulk here, gaining mass, particularly muscle. No other goals that might be associated with bulks are relevant here. 


Next I want to distinguish the big difference between *gaining/building strength* and *demonstrating/showing strength*. In the simplest terms, building strength refers to developing your strength potential, and showing strength refers to demonstrating your strength potential. It is really easy to blend these together as they share the same name and are interconnected but I will try hard to distinguish them when writing this. 

When I refer to gaining strength, or strength potential, I am referring generally to the force production potential of your muscles and any other long term adaptations relevant to the lifts you care about. I encourage you to think of this as a static value, 100% of which would represent the most you could lift under ideal circumstances. 


When I refer to demonstrating strength I am referring generally to what you can actually lift on any given rep, once all the factors the influence that rep have been accounted for. Think of this as a percentile system based on your strength potential. On any given day you might be able to ‘show’ 84% of your potential. In this case if your potential was a 100lb lift you would be able to manage an 84lb lift *for that one specific rep*. 

Another important term along these lines is Strength Specificity, this is simply how well you can apply your muscles force production potential to perform a specific movement. Things like technical improvement, mental focus, etc improve your strength specificity in a given movement.  

_____________________________________________________________________

**WHY YOU SHOULD PERSUE STRENGTH GOALS WHILE CUTTING**

Now that the boring part is out of the way, let’s get into the meat of this post. The idea that I am presenting is that you should structure your training with the goal of reaching new strength related PRs while cutting, and not while bulking. To illustrate why I think training should be done this way I will present a few arguments/points. 

First off let’s look at what you need from your training during cuts and bulks to successfully reach the goal of the period, maintaining muscle mass and building muscle mass respectively: 

**The volume/overall stimulation needed to maintain muscle is much lower then it is to build new muscle.** This is a lesson I think a lot of new lifters, and some not so new lifters, need to learn and really internalize. Many people seem to have the notion that you need to fight *harder* to keep muscle when cutting than you do to gain muscle when bulking. This just is not accurate. To draw from personal experience I used to train similarly when cutting and bulking in terms of volume. This made cutting harder, and rather unpleasant. Then I ended up cutting through quarantine in the beginnings of my home gym, with only the basics (rack, power bar, bench, lightish DBs and pullup bar). The lack of options ended up with my cutting a good deal of the extra accessory work I would usually do when cutting, because frankly I did not like doing most of the movements I had access to. Well after 3 or so months I looked the best I had. No noticeable muscle loss despite chopping off a good deal of my volume from previous cuts.

**The fatigue levels you need when bulking are higher than what you need when cutting**. This is very closely tied to the previous point but the general idea is that you need to be maintaining a constant state of mild fatigue in order to grow. Continuing to push yourself despite incomplete recovery is what prompts the body to adapt, so that it can perform those actions without fatigue accumulation later. Now I want to be clear that I am suggesting you need a constant *mild* level of fatigue. You can absolutely over-do it and accumulate *too much* fatigue, this is not the goal and is also counterproductive. When cutting, you are not trying to promote adaptation of your muscles, so you do not need this steady level of fatigue. 

**The exercise selection needed when bulking is probably more expansive than when cutting**. Again, this ties closely into the last two ideas. In order to generate the stimulus that will create the fatigue in the muscles you want to grow you are probably going to want a wider spectrum of movements. You want to be able to keep pushing all your muscles to the proper limit, and not let weak links hold back stronger areas. This is why isolation work and variations are valuable and important to include in your bulking programming (I am purposely using the wishy washy words in this section, please don’t tell me how you really don’t need isolations in the comment section. I know, skin cats and whatever, I am speaking generally here). When cutting, you might not need as many of these isolations or variations as even when your main compounds are being limited by one muscle group you are still getting some stimulus to the stronger ones and that is probably enough. 

So now we know (or at least that I think) that bulking requires **higher volume, higher fatigue, and more varied exercise selection** and that cutting requires **lower volume, lower fatigue and less varied exercise selection**. Let’s take a look at what you need in your training to reach PR lifts (or at least to reach them more easily). 

To lift at your full potential and **display your strength** you generally want to include the following components: 

**Low Fatigue**: Fatigue, while very important in promoting hypertrophy (and strength *gain*) through adaptation, is not beneficial to demonstrating your potential. If your body is tired it is not performing at 100%. I think this is obvious, but will outright state it here both to be safe and because it’s a component of this argument. 

**Higher Frequency of the Lifts you care about**: This is another area where you could make a counter argument but generally speaking more time practicing a lift is going to improve your technique and increase your *specific strength* in that lift. This applies to all time frames. Years of constant practice will (or at least should) make you better at a lift, but a lot of practice in a short period really puts an extra honed edge on your technique for the duration (at least in my experience and the experiences of others I know).
Lower Overall Volume: this is mostly for the purpose of reducing fatigue, but I am stating it directly for the sake the argument. 


Now, if you are starting to see the picture I am trying to paint great, if not I will spell it out now. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals during a bulk are **directly opposed** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals when cutting are **permissive** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. To put it in other words, trying to program for PR lifts when bulking would impede your ability to develop muscles, but trying to program for PR lifts when cutting will not impede your ability to maintain it. 

It ultimately comes down to opportunity costs. Running PR programming when bulking would give you the very best results in terms of displaying strength, but would come at the cost of sacrificing muscle gain and ‘wasting’ your bulk. Running PR programming during a cut will give *slightly* (and I do mean this, I do not think you are sacrificing very much in the way of potential due to being in a caloric deficit) reduced results, but comes at no opportunity cost, as the PR programming meets the requirements for maintaining muscle mass. 

________________________________________________________________________

**HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR TRAINING**

Having covered the *why* of this kind of training, let’s take a general look at the *how*. 

If you want to summarize how you should be approaching training under this philosophy it should be like this: Bulking is for Building, Cutting is for Revealing. Your bulks should be structured with a focus on building muscle, building strength, and generally improving your potential. Cutting should be structured to focus on losing fat to reveal that muscle, and peaking your strength to reveal it in the form of PRs. 

**Bulking:** There are *a lot* of correct way to go about bulking. I am not going to go into too much detail about the how here. If you are a relatively advanced lifter you probably have a good idea of what kinds of programming you like and what is effective for you. If you aren’t then, like I said earlier, this post isn’t *really* for you but here are some programs to look into that I either have run and could support for this purpose or have heard enough good things about to safely suggest:

-nSuns 531LP/CAP3 

-531 Building the Monolith, BBB, or really any leader program (I think, I’m not really a scholar of 531)

-Deep Water Training (I should plug /u/MythicalStrength ‘s Mass Building program review where he ran a combination of 531/DW. Go read that if you want to know how to bulk good). 

-Average 2 Savage 2.0 or whatever it is called now. 

-John Meadows Stuff in general, more specifically Gamma Bomb. 

This is not an exhaustive list, go ask big and strong people what they ran to get big and strong. 

**Cutting:** This I will go into a bit more detail as it’s the part that is going to differ more from the norm than the bulking portion. Here you are going to want to choose or design programming that includes *lower volume* and *higher frequency* in whatever lifts you are trying to PR. I think the key here is you need to narrow in on, and pick one or two lifts that you want to try and grab PRs on. You can only have high frequency of so many things before you stop having low volume. I would suggest one or two lifts. If two, pick an upper and a lower. I would suggest really putting your focus during the cutting period on your compound lifts. You want to spread the stimulus around while conserving your energy so compounds are going to be very efficient for you. Keep your accessory work to a minimum. 

I am a big fan of two compound lifts a day, an upper and a lower, then accessories. If you choose something like this you would want to include maybe one pair of accessory movements after the main lifts, maybe 3-4 sets, that’s it. If you only want one compound a day you could have 3-4 accessory movements. But again, the goal here is to *maintain*. The extra work beyond that is mostly wasted on accessories, save it for putting more intensity into your focused main lifts. 

If you have a different method of peaking/honing strength feel free to use it obviously. I don’t have a very long list of programs that are suited for this but I could suggest looking at:

-[Simple Jack’d](https://reddit.com/r/SimpleJackd/comments/qj546t/previous_versions/), specifically the earlier versions with 1-2 focused lifts performed daily


-28 Free Program (Nuckols): using a 3 day plan for your chosen lift and one day of the others would probably get you pretty close to what you are aiming for. Make sure to customize the listed accessories a bit or you will end up with a lot of lower if you choose something like 3 Day Squat/1 Day Bench/1 Day Dead. 

**Cutting and Bulking Lengths:** 

I personally feel that this system works better with shorter, more frequent cycles, rather than the 6-9 months bulk/3 months cut before summer that is more common. I think that shorter periods are better *period* for more advanced lifters but that’s another topic. The reasoning for this is that while you can definitely grab PRs during a deficit, you are ultimately revealing strength potential you already have, not developing anything new. This means that once you peak up to that potential there really isn’t anywhere else to go. In my experience that is going to happen in the first 3-6 weeks. After that you can obviously keep cutting but you are losing out on the benefits of the system. By using shorter cuts and bulks you can have your body composition goals reached by the time you top out on your PRs and you can go right back on to building. 

If you are dead set on the longer cut and bulk periods I would suggest periodizing your cut. Pick a lift to focus on, get it up to PR, then back off on it and move on to focusing on another lift to get a PR on, repeat as needed until you are done with your cut. 

I should also mention that you should not be choosing the same lifts on back to back cut periods if you are using a shorter cycle approach. Say your bulks are 10-12 weeks. How much potential do you really think you built on a specific lift in that time period? The answer is not that much. Pick something you have not focused on in a while as it will have a bigger backlog of unrealized potential to tap into.

**How to Structure your Focused Lifts and When to PR:**

If you are trying to build up your own programming I am going to suggest what I use, and that is high frequency, up to every day, for your focused lift(s). What this is going to look like is probably 3-6 fairly easy days and 1-2 harder days per week.

 You want the easier days to be just that, easy, remember the goal is to *minimize fatigue* most of these days are just to accumulate technical practice to really fine tune your lifts. I recommend a ‘daily minimum* in terms of total reps and weight used and build up from that. I shamelessly stole this general idea from the Simple Jack’d programs. This means you might have a minimum of X reps at Y weight. You do this every session at least. If you aren’t feeling it during warm up its fine to just do this minimum and call it a day. Make it super easy and do it as X singles if you really want. Just get it done. If you *are* feeling it you can build up. Do X+5 reps at Y, or X reps at Y+20lbs, or X+3 reps at Y+15lbs, whatever. If you do build up things should still say pretty easy, if you are grinding reps you have gone too far. 

 You can plan for the harder days to be a specific day of the week or just take them when you feel like things are moving well. You can use a specific goal for the heavier days or just go in thinking “I’m going to see where I get to but I’m going to make sure it’s hard”. This system really is about self-regulation. If you suck at that maybe do something else. 

When it comes to deciding when you are going to PR you can plan it out or just go by feel. I mostly do the later. If you are moving your warmups and your first working set(s) super well and think it’s a good day to push then go for it. You could also go with using a planned ‘hard’ day as a PR day There are no wrong answers here. 

I will caution against a trap I constantly fall into and that’s rapid PR attempts. It’s easy to hit a PR that moved really well/better than expected and think you can totally do more the next day or the day after and grab another PR right away. You might, but really this is very counter-productive. PRs are very fatiguing, and every attempt, or failed attempt, is eating into your chances for another at some point in your cut. Unless you are at the end of your cut and just want to give it a shot because you are done after that either way give yourself a gap and a series of ‘easy’ days to shed fatigue and get yourself set up for another proper attempt. 

_______________________________________________________________________

**MY LAST CUT: AN EXAMPLE:**

My last cut lasted for ~5 weeks, I started in the 275lb range and ended in the 255lb range. Half of that is my regular water shift between deficit and surplus so I lost ~10lbs of actual mass. I cut on hard deficits because I do not find them very hard to maintain and they do not seem to hurt my progress. They allow me to get solid results in the short time-frames I allot for bulking. It’s also worth nothing that I am a giant (6’5”) with an enormous TDEE. I’m still consuming a lot of calories/nutrients when at a deep deficit. You might not have as much luck trying to copy the degree of this deficit if you are not large and highly active. I consume ~3500 calories when cutting and ~6000 when bulking. I have a rough overview of the specifics here:

>Here is my ~5.5-6k Bulking Diet (6'5"" ~265) 

>My 'core' diet which is all I eat while cutting is [here](https://imgur.com/a/3jhMs3z)

>That's ~3500 once you factor in sauces/condiments/all the other odds and ends I use for flavor. 

>When bulking I add the following: 

>2 servings of oats a day (300cal) 

>A snack mix consisting of Cheerios, dry fruits, and some nuts. I fill an old 2 gallon whey tub with it weekly and eat the entire thing over the course of the week. ~5.5k cal total, 790 cal a day. 

>A large jar of peanut butter a week, 6460/week, 920/day

>2 bags of popcorn chips and yogurt dip, 1700/week, 240/day. 

>Total/Day: 3500+ 300 + 790 + 920 + 240 = 5750/day plus whatever other odds and ends I might eat because I'm not restrictive about things like snacks at the office when bulking.

I actually underestimated the snack mix when I wrote that as I didnt have the bags at the time, its over 6000 total but you get the idea.

My cardio consists of a total of 6 miles walking with my dog daily and a 5000m row on my erg before dinner most nights. I do this when bulking and cutting. The 5k is not particularly high paced, I complete it with a 2:05-2:10/500m split average and watch TV while doing it. 

My training consisted of Log Press every day with a minimum of 205lb x 6. I went higher when I felt good and picked my PR attempts on the fly. I hit the higher rep PRs near the beginning of my cut and the low rep PRs at the end. I don’t have too much more to say about this it was almost entirely self-regulated and my goal for it was to improve my log press max and hit a bodyweight rep If I could, which I did do during the last week. I had a lot of success with this type of scheme for bench on my last cut, finally reaching 405lbs. I think I will keep using it for upper body lifts as long as it works. 

Two days a week I squatted low bar. These were just a few low rep sets at moderate intensity. My main goal for this lift was to get back into the habit (my last training block was entirely focused on front squats so I could hit my goal of 500lbs). I did not plan to PR on this lift but by the end things were moving so well I made the 545x3 PR when I decided to perform a single, hitting the double if it felt really good. After how well the second moved I decided to push for the 3rd and I think the 4th would have been a coin toss if I tried it. Based on that I felt pretty confident I could manage 605, which I did on the last week of the cut. I think that the fact I got two solid PRs despite no planning/specific training really speaks to how effective reducing your fatigue levels can be. 


Five days a week (the days I did not squat) I deadlifted. Deadlifts had the most structure of all my lifts. I decided to attempt a height progression training strategy in order to try and reach 585x20. I bought 12 .75” thick rubber paving tiles from a home improvement store. I stacked them up into 2 stacks of 6 (4.5”) to use as pulling blocks. Each week I pulled 5 reps of 585 from the blocks, and on the fifth day I pulled the set of 20. I then removed tiles from the stack each week, repeating the same day scheme at each height. The heights used were 6 tiles (4.5”), 5 tiles (3.75”), 3 tiles (2.25”) and no tiles (from the floor). I originally planned on a tile a week but I had a hard end time for this cut because I was flying out for a week to go to a wedding (I actually types this entire novel on the flights) and did not want to make the 585x20 from the floor attempt right before the trip in case it ended up tweaking something. I succeeded on every set and reached my goal of 585x20 from the floor in the 4th week. 

After this I stopped deadlifting. I was pushing for 600x20 all though my last bulk and never broke 15. 585x20 is roughly equivalent to 600x19 so it is still a huge jump. I actually really liked the height progression and will be using it in the future. I think it did a great job of letting me build up a lot of work at heavy weights while still keeping things in check fatigue wise. It also did wonders for building confidence in the lift. Knowing I *just* did the set of 20 last week from a slightly higher position made it very easy to hit the next one. It also taught me to grind even harder, I hit many reps that I probably would have called impossible before this block. 

My accessory work was preformed after the main work, and was very minimal. I used an Arms, Upper, Lower split for my accessory work, and had one day a week be a rest from accessory work. While I don’t think that the specific accessories are really at all relevant or helpful for me to list I will write out everything I remember because I assume someone will ask at some point. 

*Arms:* Double Single Handle Tricep Extensions/Bicep Curls, DB Incline seated curls, Dips, Cable Overhead Extensions and Rope/V bar push downs. I also did some Poundstone Curl sets and Poundstone Extension sets. 

*Upper:* Incline DB Hex press, Barbell bench press, SSB tricep/upper chest extension, Dips, Cable pulldowns, cable rows, SSB upper back row, Single arm ‘DB’ rows with a loaded kettleball handle, Trap Bar rows. 

*Legs:* Leg press, GHD curls, Calf raises

I'm looking for a wearable heart rate monitor that I can use to see whether I'm in an aerobic or anaerobic range and to track some HIIT workouts.

Ideally I would like to be able to download the info to my laptop and view the data but I don't want a device that requires registering an account and viewing the data through an app or website that is going to talk to the cloud like a FitBit does.

It's a little hard to find that information when viewing products. Anyone else fitness minded and also privacy concerned that has some recommendations ?

Are face pulls and band pull aparts really necessary if I'm doing rows and reverse flyes?,652,q5fan0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/q5fan0/are_face_pulls_and_band_pull_aparts_really/,297,1633895363.0,"Some of the biggest names in fitness make it sound like face pulls and band pull aparts are absolutely necessary. ""Non-negotiable"" as Jeff Cavalier puts it. My question is why? The benefits of these exercises are clear. They promote muscular balance, shoulder health, and good posture by targeting the rear delts, rhomboids, and rotator cuff. Rows and reverse flyes also directly target these muscles though, so what is it that makes these exercises uniquely beneficial. I realize external rotation isn't possible with most row variations which is an important part of targeting the rotator cuff, but this is easily done with reverse flyes by using a supinated grip.

I don't want to grow muscles on my upper body, but mostly on my legs and glutes. I would just like to train my back a little for a better posture, but I don't see any reason to train my arms. But then again I'm worried it would look weird if I have a visibly trained lower body but untouched arms. I would want to tighten the muscles in my arms at least but I heard tightening muscles is a myth and I also don't understand what you do differently when you want to tighten muscles in contrast to growing them. Especially if I have to be in a caloric surplus to grow muscles on my legs and glutes, then how can I simultaneously tighten them on different places and not grow them. It would only make sense to me to be in a caloric deficit if you want to tighten muscles. But I have no idea, so please correct me if I'm wrong....",2021-10-08 14:58:08

[Before and after pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/1qfkqUg) Too be honest these aren't the best pictures to represent this. I was never going for looking bigger, just being stronger. I never thought to take a proper before/after picture because of this. So, yeah this is as close as it's going to get! (And to be honest I think the front squat PR video gives you a decent idea of body size change!)

**The template I followed after 531 BBB (I call it 531 x 365, with actual credit of the title coming from** u/3pIcenTer\*\*):\*\*

531 has so many templates and I’m stubborn. So I made up my own. It’s very basic and anyone with a basic understanding of 531 programming should get the idea of it. Without going into it too much, 531 usually has 3 main sets followed by 5 supplemental sets. Not always, but that’s the pattern that most templates follow.

I wanted something that mimicked a cycle of volume, followed by a cycle of intensity, and worked up to a yearend total. (Approximately a year, a little less than that) So I present to you the 531 template that you can run for almost an entire year. Once it’s over, retest your maxes, enter a new TM (if it’s lower than the current, always use the lower number) and then repeat over and over until you die.

I call it 531 x 365. (Get it, because you can do it all year) I used a 90% TM, but if I were to repeat it I would probably use a 85%. Maybe even an 80%.

**How it works:**

Supplemental work changes every cycle, main work follows traditional 531 programming. Supplemental work is always based off of the increased TM. I chose to increase all of my TM’s by 5 pounds except for my OHP which I increased by 2.5 pounds a cycle.

**Cycle 1: Volume**

4 day split, OHP, Squat, Bench, Deads each having their own day. Preferably rest day after two days on, then 2 more days on, then 2 rest days. Works great as a Monday, Tuesday, off on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, off on the weekend schedule. Do what you have to do though.

Cycle 1 focuses on volume for the supplemental work. Do your 3 main sets and then your supplemental sets will look like this.

* 5 sets of 12 reps of 45% of your TM. Repeat this same weight for the entire cycle for your supplemental work.

**Cycle 2: Intensity**

Supplemental work done as:

* 5 sets of 6 of 75% of your TM

**Cycle 3: Volume**

* 5 sets of 11 at 50% of your TM

**Cycle 4: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 5 at 80% of your TM

**Cycle 5: Volume**

* 5 sets of 10 at 55% of your TM

**Cycle 6: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 4 at 85% of your TM

**Cycle 7: Volume**

* 5 sets of 9 at 60% of your TM

**Cycle 8: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 3 at 90% of your TM

**Cycle 9: Volume**

* 5 sets of 8 at 65% of your TM

**Cycle 10: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 2 at 95% of your TM

**Cycle 11: Volume**

* 5 sets of 7 at 70% of your TM

**Cycle 12: Test Maxes or Do TM test, adjust to the lower TM and start over from the beginning.**

By lower TM I mean the following:

You start with a TM of 200 on bench press. After 12 cycles your TM is now 260. When you test your maxes you find out that your actual max for bench is actually 260. Using the 90% TM means the new TM you would use is now 235.

In a different example, you started with a 200 pound TM on bench, but when you test your new max you actually bench 300. This would suggest that your new TM should be 270, but stick with the 260.

Stick with the lower number and you’ll have less chances of getting stuck. What do you do if you get stuck? Follow normal 531 protocol. I never stalled on this programming.

**Accessories:**

Do what 531 programming suggest or do your own thing. I did my own thing and had great success with it.

I reached my strongest point by doing the following for accessories.

1. Find a TM for your accessory just like you would a main lift. Either max out or find a top set of 3-5 where you couldn’t do more reps. Then take a 90% of that to get a TM.
2. Take your TM and take 70% of that and 50% of that.
3. Do 3 sets at 70% of your TM like this: 5, 5, 5+
4. Do 2 sets at 50% of your TM like this: 10, 10
5. Keep the same weight for the entire cycle and just try to beat your + set
6. If you could get all of the minimal reps on all 5 sets (at least 5 on the 3rd set) then increase the weight by the smallest amount possible. If it’s a machine that goes up by 2.5 pounds then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a bar that you can put 2.5’s on either side then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a machine that you can add 10 pounds to as the minimal number then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If you can’t complete the reps then either lower the weight or repeat the weight next cycle.

**My bench day accessories:**

* Row, lateral raises, close grip bench (giant superset thingy)

**OHP day:**

* Weighted dips, Chest flys/superset with reverse flys, rows

**Deadlift day:**

* Lat Pulldowns, shrugs, leg extensions superset with leg curls

**Squat day:**

* Split squats, weighted back extensions, lat pulldowns

Ab rollouts or hanging leg raises every day. If I had extra time I would do a facepull/tricep superset with the ropes or a curl/forearm curl superset.

Some kind of conditioning every workout and on most rest days.

My accessories often changed if I got bored or wanted to train for a specific event, but for the most part I would keep them the same so I could track progress. Sometimes I would do cleans with an axle bar or regular bar after a squat or deadlift workout. Sometimes I’d do incline bench press instead of close grip bench. Sometimes I would do leg press, hack squats, or smith machine squats instead of leg extensions or split squats on one of my lower body days.

**Conditioning:**

Usually done every day. I would often rest on the weekend and not do too much. Conditioning always changed based on the current needs. If I had nothing to prep for it was just sled pushes/pulls, jogging, sprinting, and bike.

If I was prepping for a comp it was usually comp specific. High volume lift representing the strongman event. Tire flips, vehicle pushing, sled pushing, power cleans, carrying stuff, etc…

**Other:**

Every other week or so I would skip my Wednesday rest day and take Friday off so I could train strongman events on Saturday.

**Diet:**

I usually ate quite a bit. Between 3,500 – 4,000 calories for the most part unless I was cutting weight. I often cut shortly after comps because I liked to drop 5-10 pounds and then bulk up into my next competition. Felt like I was stronger if I was gaining weight so I never went into a competition dropping body weight. It has worked pretty well. I’ve brought home some cool strongman trophies!

I just tried to eat around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. I ate like every 3 hours because sometimes I would get caught up and not eat enough to go along with my training.

Supplements? Just some caffeine and creatine. Fish oil.  Mostly pizza.

**Findings:**

The first week of the new cycle was always a killer. Week 2 was much better and by week 3 the supplemental work felt like I was throwing it around. It wasn’t uncommon that I had to rest for the last set or two of the supplemental work on week 1. Maybe on OHP I would have to Push Press most of the last set. Deads turned into touch and go’s, etc…

Other than that I really liked it. I would almost get nervous/excited for a new cycle and I really liked knowing exactly what I was working towards for almost the entire year.

At first I was able to push the + sets early on. As the TM’s got heavier and heavier I was doing 5 pro’s more often. I think if I would have picked the lower TM this wouldn’t have been an issue and the next time I run this that’s the plan.

**Random notes:**

I love doing the supplemental work as a variation of the main work. The important thing is to use the appropriate TM for the different work. I don’t suggest basing it off of the TM of your main work.

For the most part I would pause my main bench sets, but do touch and go’s on the supplemental.

Trap bar the main deadlifts (if I was preparing for a car deadlift) and conventional deadlifting the supplemental.

Using front squats or SSB squats as the main work and doing the supplemental as back squats.

Using the log or axle every now and then on OHP, etc…

**What’s next?**

I’m going to challenge myself in the next weight class in strongman. I’m going to follow BBBeefcake, BTM, and deep water. The goal is to gain 20 pounds, then follow it up with 12 weeks of other programming while I cut 10 of those pounds back off. Repeat for another 20 pound gain and then another 10 pound cut. That will put me right around 225 body weight, a nice place to be when competing in the 231 weight class as I can go into comps gaining weight like I usually do. Maybe I get fluffy. Maybe I look buff. At the end of the day I don’t care too much as long as I get stronger.

Then??? Who knows.",2021-10-07 00:01:03

**Sleep deprivation slows fat loss and burns muscle instead**

>Two studies have looked at the effects of sleep restriction in an energy deficit on body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) in adults \[[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951287/); [23](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/5/zsy027/4846324)\].  In these studies, all participants lost body weight. However, the  sleep deprived participants lost more fat-free mass (i.e muscle and  water).  
>  
>""We found that sleep restriction resulted in less loss of fat but greater loss of lean mass (...)."" - Wang et al. 2018 ([23](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/5/zsy027/4846324))

**Sleep longer for faster fat loss**

>The current evidence suggests that increasing sleep duration and quality is  beneficial for losing body fat. This might be because you are less likely to overeat, the longer you sleep \[[43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/)\].  
Three studies have found that sleeping longer is associated with reduced fat mass ([54](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141273/), [43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/), [41](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31983513/#:~:text=No%20differences%20in%20cortisol%20or,treatment%20of%20obesity%20in%20adolescents.)) (...)

**Energy balance**

>Overall, sleep restriction makes you more passive, thus expending less energy  (...)  Some researchers have concluded that energy expenditure is not  the primary component linking sleep deprivation to excess body fat, and  is  rather influenced by increased hunger and calorie intake \[[29](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23102177/); [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018785/)\].

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

I'll put this in the beginning just to get it out of the way: 

[Start](http://imgur.com/a/gTJtyqL) / [3 Months](http://imgur.com/a/AdqKRNv) / [6 Months](http://imgur.com/a/BP3SrIG) 

Some older background: Luckily for myself, I've always been fairly athletic and played a bunch of sports growing up, including baseball, football, and basketball. I had never really considered my weight an issue, as I felt I was fairly muscular because I played sports. 

Some newer background: Right before this, I was drinking somewhere between 3-6 beers a day. I was also only eating maybe two meals a day. Pair that with a super fast metabolism, and you get overly underweight and a lose of strength. 

One day, I decided to buckle down, cut drinking cold turkey, eat more, and change for the better. 

I had some previous gym experience freshman year of college and some from a little bit before covid, so I felt somewhat comfortable trying to get back into the swing of things. I used some of what I knew previously, as well as looking thru the fitness wiki and this subreddit, to decide on what routine I'd get myself into. Ultimately, I decided to use the program listed in this post here: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). 

I decided on a PPL split only because that's what I used to do before, it's what I felt most comfortable with, and I couldn't figure out the difference between all the other splits with the information overload. I adapted some of it to fit some of the workouts I wanted to include, and it's changed over time. Listed below are what I started with (with weights) and what I'm currently at (with weights). One disclaimer: I did end up switching gyms, so some of the weights don't translate properly. I don't understand why at different gyms or between different equipment, some weight numbers mean different things on different machines, but it is what it is.

All x2, Every Other Day 

So yeah, there's that. I usually do this six days a week, barring any outside circumstances. 

As for my diet, that's a strange thing. I'm the type of person that is perfectly content with eating the same three meals, every day, with minimal effort in making all three. People make fun of me all the time, but it is what it is. The schedule of my job doesn't really allow me to cook dinner often either. I try and eat things that are cheap, high in protein, and high in calories. If I can get all three of those things, I'm happy with eating it. With that, my daily meal and snack list is the same. Same bowl of cereal for breakfast, same turkey sandwich for lunch, same frozen pasta bowls for dinner. Listed below in the link are screenshots of all three meals and a snack, as well as the nutritional content of what I get throughout the day. I know I probably eat too much protein and maybe sodium. If anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know. 

[Diet](http://imgur.com/a/Sg0sZc8) 

Other things to include:  
- In the past month and a half, I've started to use pre-workout. I personally use Pre-Jym.  
- In the past month or so, I've started to use creatine. 

Main things I've learned:  
- Form is most important (given).  
- Breathing control is second most important (basically, to me).  
- Eating more and better really did make a world of difference.  
- You can surprisingly go up in weight wayyyy quicker in the beginning than I thought. 

Things I'm working on:  
- Mainly incorporating deadlifts into my routine. Thinking about first exercise on my pull day before barbell rows. Would remove back raises.  
- Trying to focus on my chest. Always been the weakest part of my body. Not exactly sure how to be more dynamic and really hit it hard. 

Things holding me back:  
- From three to six months, I feel like I've had minimal visible change. I've increased in weight a decent bit in some areas. Am I plateauing? (hence use of pre-workout and creatine).  
- For the last few weeks to months, I've had progressively worse left golfer's elbow tendinitis. I've been working to reduce the root cause of it while increasing the stretching of my wrist/forearm area. I have been working thru it currently (although it's probably not recommended).  
- My right shoulder is weird. Overuse of throwing a baseball (possibly incorrectly) when I was younger has caused it. Kinda feels like it pops a lot. Kinda feels painful at times. Kinda seems like rotator cuff, but really not. I don't think it is. Who knows. 

But yeah, ultimately that's my progress, journey, and guide to where I'm at now. I'm open to suggestions on any aspect of what I've done so far, whether it be focus exercises or dietary changes, so please let me know! Thank you all very much.

Edit: Reddit is a very weird place man. I'm very jaded when it comes to this post now. I woke up this morning to a TON of people telling me I wasn't underweight and basically shitting on me. First off, my bad. I don't periodically check my BMI. I haven't done that since they make you do it in high school. Plus, what else am I exactly supposed to reference for being underweight? I don't ask other people for their weights and to see them with their shirts off. In my mind, I was underweight. For that, I guess I apologize for being wrong for something I didn't even know about. If I could edit the title, I would. I'm jaded because I've seen this sub help a lot of people, I've asked questions in it and looked for help, and I've seen people make some great progress too. I was surprised when I made a lot of progress, so I thought I'd share because I figured it could help others too. But a part of me wants to say screw it and delete the whole post altogether because people are getting mad over me not knowing I wasn't underweight. What's the point of trying to be positive when every comment is shitting on you for an uneditable title? I don't know what else to say.",2021-09-27 00:09:29

4/3/2/1 Plate Dead/Squat/Bench/Press – The Scenic Route,125,prut5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/prut5b/4321_plate_deadsquatbenchpress_the_scenic_route/,23,1632144207.0,"**Intro:**

A lot of the posts on this subreddit are about the most efficient/effective way to reach your goals and if you have the time/energy/dedication to do that I have the utmost respect for you. This post, however, is not like that. I have just reached my personal goal of achieving a 4 plate (180 kg) deadlift, 3 plate (140 kg) squat, 2 plate (100 kg) bench press and 1 plate (60 kg) strict shoulder press, all in all this has taken me eight years (two years of messing around + six years of more dedicated lifting), hence why the title of this post is ‘the scenic route’ and I am here to tell you that story.

**Background:**
I am British (hence the use of kgs, sorry ‘mericans) and in highschool I was the classic lanky emo kid, in terms of sporting background I did dance and swimming up until the age of around 14/15 and then didn’t really do anything sporty until starting to go to the gym at around 17 years old. From around age 17 to age 19 my going to the gym was very sporadic and intentionless so I have not included it in detail here. I  properly got into fitness at around age 19. I am currently in the final year of grad school at a top UK uni (think Oxbridge) and studying a subject which is an experimental science, as such I have not been able maintain much consistency in my lifting (I’ll go into more detail below).

**Before and After:**

As I will also explain below, I am not really involved in fitness for aesthetic reasons but I know you guys will want to see pics anyway, these are the best ones I had easy access to. 

https://imgur.com/XUSuyt2

Bonus titty pic: https://imgur.com/FBJQX3k

**Stats:**

**Before:** 2015, age 19, height 6’3’’ (190 cm) weight: ?? (I’d guess 60-65 kg)

Deadlift: Untrained

Squat: Untrained

Bench: ~60 kg for a shaky double

Shoulder Press: ~20 kg for reps

**After:** 2021, age 26, height: 6’3’’ weight: 82-86 kg

4/3/2/1 baby!! 

**Motivation:**

I lift solely for my mental health, in 2015 I was diagnosed with depression and in 2020 I was also diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, I take antidepressants but lifting has changed my life. Lifting is the thing which keeps my mental health in check but also the fact that I am able to make small goals which are achievable within weeks really helps when my day-to-day life is working towards a goal which is a long way in the distance (like a PhD). Obviously it is nice to make some aesthetic improvements too but this is not my personal goal.

**Training History:**

Pre-University
As mentioned above I sporadically attended the gym (perhaps once or twice a month) from ages 17 through 19 but looking back, I made little progress in this time 

Undergraduate

When I began going to the gym as an undergraduate, I spent perhaps the first two years doing various forms of bro-split (think chest and tris, back and bis etc.). This sort of thing gets a really bad rep on this site and while it is true that bro-splits are not a very efficient way of training they do have their benefits, namely:

* Getting used to being in a gym – gyms are very scary for newcomers especially lanky emo kids, just getting used to being in that space can take time
* Getting used to being under a bar – although at this time my only real barbell exercise was the bench press, just getting used to holding something heavy in your hands is really important
* Ease and simplicity – with a Bro-split there is no pre-planning no spreadsheets, no faff, you just go to the gym and if it hits your chest and your tris and there’s no queue you go for it

The next program I ran was PHUL, at this point in my training I became aware that ‘training programmes’ existed and pretty much found the first one I could and did that. I would say that PHUL is a good programme for bodybuilding style training but probably this was not the right time in my training to do it, nonetheless I found the following benefits:

* Getting used to a programme/logging workouts
* Lots of variety so not too boring
* Definitely made gains faster than a bro-split 

There was also the following negatives:

* Lonnngggg workouts, especially when working out with a training partner

* Now, as someone interested in powerlifting I would class there as being a lot of unnecessary 
accessory movements and not enough focus on the main lifts (but that is very personal).

This brings me to around the end of my undergraduate degree so at this point I am 22 years old and my stats are around:
Deadlift: 100 kg
Squat: 80-90 kg
Bench: 80 kg
Shoulder Press: ~40kg for reps.

Grad-School

While there are some people who are able to maintain consistency while at grad-school I am not one of those people. In my first couple of years of grad-school especially it was not uncommon for me to work in the lab for a minimum of 9 am-7.30 pm every day and then also work for at least some of Saturday. Also due to the nature of experiments I had to stay until past 10 pm maybe 3 or 4 nights a month. This amount of work sucks but this post is not to complain about the life of a PhD scientist it is to talk about fitness. I am also in a long-distance relationship so about one weekend in every three I am not in my university city to train.

My ethos for my training in grad school has been, when you can train, train. This means that some weeks I am able to go 4 times in a week, some weeks I am able to only go once, some weeks I cant go at all. I have also had periods of months off for a wrist injury (not gym related), when I spent some time at a University in Asia and the dreaded COVID lockdowns (although I tried to do some home workouts with minimal equipment during these). Despite these setbacks I have been able to consistently increase in strength over the past 4 years, albeit slowly.
 
-
-

Programmes in Grad-School:

GZCL 

For the first couple of years of grad school I ran a GZCL style programme, I chose a 4 day split but as explained above, I was not able to be consistent with my frequency so sometimes that 4 day split happened in a week and sometimes it happened in 3 weeks.
Benefits

* My first powerlifting programme – enjoyed making consistent strength gains

* Lots of spreadsheets out there to make programming easy

* Lots of variety in rep and weight ranges so you don’t get bored

* I first hit my 100 kg bench and 180 kg deadlift during this time 

Negatives

* Sometimes you can progress faster than the programme dictates which can either lead to you being frustrated or having to mess with your spreadsheets

* Workouts can sometimes be quite long

5/3/1

I ran 5/3/1 for around a year pre-COVID and it has been by far my favourite programme. I ran a 4-day variant but as sated above this didn’t always happen in one week. 
Benefits 

* Easy programming

* Quick workouts

* Quick gains

* I first hit my 60 kg shoulder press during this programme

Negatives

* Assistance work can be boring

Making it up

Post-COVID it has been really hard to have any consistency, in the UK we have had several lockdowns and I have also had to do some personal isolation periods for close contact etc. I am also in the final year of grad-school so my busy schedule has been even busier, as such for the last year or so I have just been making it up in the gym (which I’m sure on /r/fitness will cause people to bring out the flaming torches). My routine now is just 2 days on repeat, one day in the gym I squat and bench, the next day I can go to the gym I deadlift and shoulder press. If I have a long time that day I will do a lot of accessory movements, If I don’t have a long time I will do my main lifts and get out. With regards to weight/reps I base it on how I feel that day, some days are heavier with less reps some days are lighter with more reps

Benefits

* Extremely flexible schedule 

* Requires no planning

* Easy to workout with others

* Finally reached my 140 kg squat

Negatives

* Slower progress than a real programme

* Sometime requires more ‘on the spot’ thought about what you’re gonna do.

**Cardio**

The only cardio I do is cycling to and from the lab for a total of about 30 minutes each day, I feel this is enough to keep my heart healthy while not killing my gains.

**Equipment**

You absolutely don’t need a bag full of fancy equipment to make gains the few things I use are chalk – to grip stuff, a belt to help get a better brace, wrist wraps if my wrists are playing up and lifting shoes which are not necessary but are a nice treat as they are very comfortable/sturdy/stable to squat in. 

**Diet**

As stated above I do not workout for aesthetics I work out for my mental health, as such my diet ethos has been eat as healthy as I can, and aim for just over my tdee until my belly gets to a size I’m not happy with and then eat just under my tdee until the belly goes. In practice this means I eat around 3300 calories a day when eating above and when eating below I eat around 2500 (usually achieved by skipping breakfast). I have adjusted these goal posts slightly as I have got heavier over the years. Also for the last two years I have been vegetarian not much has changed but my shits are generally better. 

**My thoughts from my own experience**

I hope from this post I have made it clear that not every fitness journey has to take the most efficient route. Could I have achieved these goals in two years with proper training and diet? Yes, probably. Would that have fit in with my life? Absolutely not. I have a busy life and I am not willing to sacrifice other parts of it such as socialising, working or sleeping, as such, I have fit in working out where possible and I have learned not to beat myself up if I can only get to the gym one time in a week. Not every person has to reach their genetic maximum as quickly as possible, if you are going to the gym and feeling good then don’t worry, you are doing good. 

**Advice for new lifters**

* Do your research, find a programme you like the sound of that you think will help you reach your goals

* Don’t get to caught up in ‘what is the absolute best thing for me’ – going to the gym 100% of the time will be better than not going 

* Don’t listen to the people who say ‘you can always fit in lifting you’re just lazy’ sometimes you cant fit in lifting or sometimes going to that party or going to bed early is more important and that's okay.

* Don’t beat yourself up – okay you’ve missed the lift, or you’ve missed a week of training or you’re not getting where you want as fast as you want, don’t worry, not everyone works in the same way, you’ll get there.

I hope that the good folk of /r/fitness have enjoyed reading about my journey and own personal takeaways and I’m happy to discuss anything I’ve said below but please be kind and civil <3

Mike Mentzer's High-Intensity Training Protocol,193,pq7ak1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pq7ak1/mike_mentzers_highintensity_training_protocol/,77,1631908026.0,"*DISCLAIMER* I apologize in advance for my run-on sentences lmao.

Alright so before posting this I know there are going to be people that absolutely despise Mike Mentzer and his style of training, and people that completely support him and his ideas, but if possible I would appreciate if any responses to this could be kept objective for the simple fact that I am only here asking about the facts, and nothing more.

Anyways, I'm still currently in the process of reading and taking notes on his last published book ""High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way,"" and knowing that in the past about 20 years a lot more scientific research has been done, more experiments and such have been conducted, which naturally would potentially mean that some of his theories since have been indirectly or directly proven. I think that the idea of High-Intensity training is very productive in a time sense, and as it has a direct correlation with training with volume (that numerous studies have been conducted on since the book's publishing,) there has to be some kind of truth to taking weightlifting protocols of each side of the spectrum to get a specific desired end result. It makes sense that this type of training style has some if not a whole lot of legitimacy to how one could go about beginning to take one's physique to the next level, however due to his untimely passing, I nor anyone else could go to him to has him more specific questions on the how's and why's of certain principles he has in his HIT workout style. Again I do not want bias or opinion, but just facts/answers that anyone might have, or how I might find them.

So these are not coming from a place of doubt, rather genuine intent to understand why things are some of the ways he claims. Note: As I continue reading, I may continue to edit this and ask more questions that I myself cannot find the answers to.

* He frequently mentions the body's ""precious energy reserves,"" and that if too much time has been spent in the gym, the reserves would be depleted further and further as lack of proper recovery to the muscular stimulus due to over training, and/or too much time in the gym. My question is that what is that measure of ""energy reserve""? This theory makes sense on paper, however how would one 100% know the as he mentions ""precise"" threshold amount of time to which one needs to be in the gym for optimal muscle growth, and/or how would one know if that threshold has been surpassed to the point where muscular regression begins to occur? Additionally, if it begins to regress and the body will as a result need more time to recover, how would or could the amount of recovery time needed be found?
* What measurements have been taken or what studies have been done to show the not only optimal ""muscle recovery"" time, but the body's energy use recovery time from weight lifting sessions? For High-Intensity? For longer Volume workouts? 
* What effects in short term and long term would this high of intensity workouts have on the body's CNS (central nervous system)? Would adequate recovery time as he describes allow for it to completely recover as well, or would it undeniably cause it burnout?
* How much of HIS actual workouts that he himself did to attain the results he got naturally (assuming he was natural, and if you claim he is not, where can it be shown concretely that he isn't) go by the guidelines written in that book? Did he actually use that much time to recover, or were a bulk of his workouts done with slightly more volume and a bit less intensity, so that he could train a bit more than max 1-2 times a week?
* This goes hand in hand with the question above, but some have speculated that his findings and claims in that book were not representative of the actual volume of work he did to get his results, and that for a majority of the time he trained he actually worked out 3-4x a week. Hypothetically, if you were to take the workouts prescribed in the book with the same time and intensity, would it be effective to do those workouts 3-4x a week? Or are they actually so intense that you should only do one every 4-7 days like he says, because his training prior to these findings weren't quite as intense, which allowed him to workout more than once every 4-7 days?
* Would using progressive overload AND linear intensity increase in workouts and decrease in times be effective or be able to be carried out in a sort of cycle with similar or good results? 

Thank you to anyone with any kind of good or useful responses. I know it is a lot of questions I am asking, but as someone who likes to find the objective truth when it comes to implementing practices in my day to day life (especially ones I will be using that have a direct impact on my body,) I know that figuring these things out will help me be able to best piece together most effective tactics from various sources, thus allowing me to have a more effective approach to how I will be lifting, and eventually will help me be able to explore and understand even more than some that have gotten this far. I find the whole science behind bodybuilding extremely fascinating, with all the different combinations of workouts and adjustable stimuli able to be manipulated in order to achieve a specific desired effect. I know lots and LOTS of others are just as interested in this if not more than me, but if I could at all contribute to helping others and myself learn more than has already been learned, it'd be super dope. If you read this much of my spiel, hats off to you ahahahah.",2021-09-17 22:47:06

Progress Post | F 23 | September 20 - September 21,411,pphqad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pphqad/progress_post_f_23_september_20_september_21/,42,1631812869.0,"Starting weight: 125 lb

Ending weight: 130 lb

Height: 5'6""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Diet: This is something I still struggle with, specifically getting my micros in. For the first 6 months of working out, I was eating around 1800-2300 calories and went up to around 134lb. The next 6 months were more about focusing on my protein intake and it's averaged to around 1800. I try to make sure I'm eating something with meat or eggs in it everyday and I have at least 50g of protein in me even on a bad diet day.

I'm currently planning to cut down 8-10lb and am going with the following caloric plan: 1600 calories (173g carbs, 134g protein, 34g fat). 

I'm using myfitnesspal to track and assign my macros and diet. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Exercise: I'm following a PPL split. I used to do 3 leg days, 1 back/ bis and 1 chest/tris/shoulders when I started out, but had to forego this routine after it just led to my legs not recovering fast enough and also not seeing enough upper body progress. Upper body is still a weak point for me, specifically with bench and anything to do with triceps. My current PPL looks like the below:

Back/Biceps - 5x5 DL, 4x12 Bent Over Row, 4x12 Seated Cable Row, 3x10 Hammer Curls, 3x10 Zottman Curls, 1-3 sets of 21s

Chest/Triceps/Shoulders - 5x5 OHP, 4x8 Bench, 3x12 Tricep Cable Pulldowns, 3x12 Overhead Dumbbell Extension

Legs (Quads/Glutes) - 3x8 Squat, 3x12 Hip Thrusts, 3x10 Bulgarian Split Squat, 3x12 Leg Extension

Rest Day

Back/Biceps

Chest/Triceps/Shoulders - same routine, but 5x5 bench first and then 4x8 OHP

Legs(Hamstrings/Glutes) - 3x8 Squat, 3x12 Hip Thrusts, 3x10 Bulgarian Split Squat, 3x10 Back Hyperextension, 3x12 Seated Leg Curl

I used to mainly rely on squats to build my legs at the start, but I realized this was a bad idea back in June as it led to a lot of quad dominance and was a factor in my knee injury. Focusing on isolated leg work like BSS has really helped with my knee pain and also helped increase overall definition of my legs. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Lifts:

Diddly: 155lb 1RM (Starting lift - 60 lb)

Squat: 105lb for 3x8 (could go higher I think, but I injured my knee which set back progress. Don't want another repeat of that) (Starting lift - just the bar)

OHP: Bar for 5x6 (Starting lift - 5 lb dumbbells)

Bench: 65lb for 5x5 (Starting lift - 7.5 lb dumbbell press)

Once again, /u/mythicalstrength has his finger on the pulse and puts words to some things I've been ruminating on as well.  

The tldr should be pretty obvious: big changes in this space take time and persistence, but our modern day lifestyles and the marketing gimmicks that hack into them don't set up the uninitiated to be prepared for this stark reality.  

To add something of my own to the conversation, this lack of patience also seems to rob people of the satisfaction of the short term results they have achieved:  

""I've lost 16lb in 3 months and I'm not at my goal weight, where am I going wrong?""   

""I've been lifting for a year and despite improving my lifts greatly, my quads don't look like this professional bodybuilder's, what am I missing?""  

These people have achieved very real and very important successes, but because they have been blinded by the 'instant results' hoopla, they've denied themselves the gratification of this particular instant.

**Intro**:

Salutations from the bodyweight fitness and calisthenics community! I just wanted to make a post showing my 5 years of progress in fitness and how calisthenics and gymnastics changed my fitness journey in the past 2 years.

Since this is a general fitness discord, I'd thought it'd be cool focus and share some of the fun stuff and training that goes on with bodyweight fitness :)

**General Thoughts and Summary**:

So to keep a long story short, I started lifting in middle school (around 7th grade). At the time I didn't really know much about training and I wasn't consistent so I lifted weights on and off all the way through high school (2016 picture).

Once I got to college, I had easier access to a gym and got a bigger and stronger because of that (2019 picture). I trained with weights and focuses mainly on bodybuilding.

* The convenience of my college gym was really conducive to my progress.
* Having a base fitness background isn't need for bodyweight training but is helpful.

Then around the end of my junior year in college, I met some people that showed me calisthenics so I started training it the Summer of 2019 and fell in love with it. I incorporated it into my training and exercised a lot more frequently.

As time went on I started training on Gymnastics rings, now I'm the strongest and fittest I've ever been (2021 picture). The things I'm currently training are quite high level.

Here's just some general thoughts regarding that.

* Consistency is king, I became much stronger through calisthenics because I was training more regularly vs when I was purely lifting weights.
* Really enjoying my training made it much more effortless to exercise which helped with consistency.
* Bodyweight training can expose weak links and lagging areas. I developed more mobility and body control because calisthenics movements required more of that. This also helped me reduce injuries because I had to ensure my weakest links were strong.
* Turns out I'm very good at calisthenics and rings. My body type is quite ideal for that so I've been able to achieve some very high level skills

If you're someone that's tired/bored of their current training style, then maybe exploring other forms of training, such as bodyweight exercises, might be what you're looking for. Currently I do mainly calisthenics with weight lifting supplementary exercises.

My current goal is to achieve F skills on rings (Pretty much moves you only really see in the Olympics),  wish me luck :)

&#x200B;

**Training**:

* **Lifting Experience**:

So I pretty much did bro splits from middle school to most of college. I forget the exact splits I did but it probably wasn't anything smart of well thought out. I think it was something like: Biceps + Back, Triceps + Chest, Shoulder + Something Else, and Legs

Really most of my progress at this time was noob gains and that I was lifting regularly. I didn't have any strong or impressive numbers on my lifts but I could rep out pushups and pullups. I also dabbled in weighted pullups and dips.

I think the main thing was weightlifting gave me a good strength foundation for when I eventually swapped to calisthenics. My two main problems with weightlifting were that personally for me I could've been more consistent with it and that I was always tight and stiff because I purely lifted and that's pretty much it.

Then I made the jump to calisthenics.

&#x200B;

* **General Info on Calisthenics**:

Before I get more into the calisthenics part of my training, just wanted to provide some general info.

1. There's many different things that fall under the umbrella of bodyweight training, I focused mainly on calisthenics and ring strength training.
2. Calisthenics strength training is similar to powerlifting (weighted calisthenics is basically just powerlifting but with weighted pullup, muscle up, and dips) and weight training in terms of training principle but instead of lifting weights you use your body. We use **progressions** (easier versions of exercises) to progressively overload to ultimately achieve some move usually referred to as a **skill**.
3. It's not just HIIT or high pushups and pullups!
4. Because our entire bodies are used, you'll notice weak links when you're training. This is great because in the long run it can bring up lagging body parts and lead to more balance, coordination, and mobility (can't do a handstand if you don't have shoulder mobility). Good form is very important!
5. One thing to highlight is a lot of high level strength moves require straight arms (referred to as **straight arm strength** or SAS). Because of that, we also have to account for our tendons and joints because some moves can hit them quite hard. Tendons take longer to develop than muscle so it's wise to not try to progress too fast, you can risk injuring yourself.
6. Don't want to toot my own horn but don't take my progress as being indicative of everyone that trains calisthenics. The progress I've made is quite fast and I'm currently doing moves some people have dedicated years to achieving. I'm probably around the top 1-2% of people strength skill wise training calisthenics. But definitely try, it's an awesome time!
7. Sorry if some of the exercise names/terms aren't familiar to you! The clips I have linked should show what they look like. Here's a chart that does a pretty good job of listing exercises and their level of difficulty: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit?usp=sharing)
8. Skills difficulty rating. So the Gymnastics Code of points rates skills from A - K where A is the easiest and F is the hardest. For rings, the highest scoring moves are F. Right now I've achieved/working on C, D, E skills. For context an Iron Cross ([https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/39/fd/7939fd84b0e836f8d773f7c74288f69f.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/39/fd/7939fd84b0e836f8d773f7c74288f69f.jpg)) is a B skill.

Hopefully this clears up some things and provides a bit of context. Definitely check out r/bodyweightfitness FAQ for more info, it's a useful resource!

Ok now to the calisthenics stuff!

* **Summer Before Senior Year**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=183](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=183)

Around June of 2019 is when I started. After doing research I decided I'd train for a front and back lever. I just YouTubed ""Front Lever"" tutorial and ""Back Lever"" tutorial and found a bunch of useful progressions and exercises which I incorporated into my lifting routine.

Essentially what I did was FL on pull and BL on push days. I trained PPLPP (or something like that I can't remember). The way I structured my workout was Static progressions in the beginning, then dynamics, then weights (which could be weighted calisthenics, bench, accessory workout etc.)

Overall, training was pretty straight forward and I got both moves before the end of the summer.

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 1**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=324](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=324)

Once the summer was over, I decided to continue my current training style. I focused on calisthenics with weights but now that I had FL and BL (with ok form. I also couldn't do it all the time) I decided I would work towards full planche.

So I pretty much continued in a similar training manner as I mentioned earlier and eventually got a full planche by the end of the semester (or about 4 months). Well, not really...Because my form was actually really bad and my elbows were bent so I wasn't actually doing a full planche. I didn't realize it at the time that I wasn't actually planching. Because I didn't know better I continued on thinking I was ready for harder moves.

I made a post regarding my planche mistake previously here if you want to take a look at that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full\_planche\_vs\_fake\_plache\_do\_it\_right\_the\_first/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full_planche_vs_fake_plache_do_it_right_the_first/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 2**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=456](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=456)

When my last semester of Senior year started I joined the gymnastics club and made some really cool friends. I also had access to a gymnastics gym too. This is where I fell in love with rings and realized I wanted to train towards advanced ring moves.

So I started working towards Iron Cross and full planche on rings. I used the straps on forearms method to train for cross, but honestly it was mostly a waste of time. The straps didn't really develop the proper straight arm strength for cross, so other than some initial shoulder development I didn't find it useful.

I was also making fake progress on planche too (I thought it was real progress at the time). I progress all the way from tuck to a full planche (bent arms so it doesn't count) on rings. I also started exploring planche pushups but again the form was terrible.

On the bright side, my weighted calisthenics was going well. I increased my one rep max weighted pull and chinup to 2 plates. I also could do dips with a plate and a half with good form. I could also do 2 plates but it wasn't parallels so I don't count it. Oh I also got one arm chinups so that was also pretty awesome too!

&#x200B;

* **Summer**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=621](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=621)

So my senior year was a cut a bit short because COVID started at this point. I went back home around April 2020. I luckily made the smart decision to buy a power rack and continue training in my backyard and house which really payed off.

Earlier I started noticing there were weird quirks with my planche but I was still convinced I had a full planche. I posted a form check on reddit and someone pointed out my arms were bent. I was sad about it for a little while but eventually came to terms with it.

Again, check out the planche or YT video for more details b/c I'm mostly repeating myself. But TLDR I started from scratch, got injured from planche training for a few weeks, recovered, trained it some more but correctly (eblows locked) and eventually got a full planche.

For other moves Iron Cross was still a grind, I had to go through a few iterations and setups on how to train it to replace the strap method. I eventually ended on using resistance bands but my form always felt off so I was in an awkward limbo with the move.

On the bright side, around this time I started dabbling in other moves to improve on. They include front lever rows, one arm front lever, RTO dips, impossible dips, and victorian cross. I will never achieve these moves.

It was around this time I also found out about ""Overcoming Gravity 2"". I think it's really good and useful book. Great reference point for training and it helped me start thinking of other training concepts that I eventually started incorporating later on.

&#x200B;

* **Fall and Winter**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=936](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=936)

Once it started getting too cold to train outside, I moved my stuff inside and continued training. I made a good amount of progress during this time. All the foundational work I improved on over the summer began paying dividends.

I could actually full planche for a few seconds so I started working towards harder variations like full planche pushups and planche press.

Iron Cross was still kicking my ass so no real update there.

I managed to get a few reps of FL rows with a false grip and some of the other moves I was dabbling with over the summer where also improving. The most noteworthy one is that my victorian cross form was shaping up well. I was using lighter bands.

Really the main thing that happened during this time is the gradual progress I was making with most things I was training and the fact I incorporating some simple periodization. I spent a more time refreshing my knowledge of training and periodization was one thing that really stuck out to me. Incorporating that helped me feel less tired and in danger of hurting myself in the long run vs what I used to do (i.e. not take deload weeks)

&#x200B;

* **Now**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1050](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)

Ok at this point I got really strong. Training wise I had a good understanding of how my body worked and how I needed to structure my workouts that worked best for me. I also incorporated a bit more complex periodization (though it wasn't always consistent) where I would ramp up and build towards strength phases. Also, I bought a dream machine for cross training, it was pricey but I found it useful.

Here's some clips of some of the other things I've managed to achieve. A lot of this skills are quite advanced so I'm really proud of myself :)

* Full Planche, Full Planch Pushups, Full Planch on Rings, Full Planche Press to Handstand: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1050](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)
* Impossible Dips and 3 Plate Dip: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1135](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1135) (not bellow parallel so needs more work)
* Front Lever Rows and One Arm Front Lever: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1228](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1228)
* 3 Plate Chinup: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1254](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1254)
* Maltese: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1288](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1288)
* Victorian Cross: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1272](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1272) which was super sick, you rarely see this in the Olympics.
* and more

Still no iron cross...hate that move. The dream machine I bought has been much more helpful in training towards it bs bands though so that's nice. Slowly making progress on it now!

&#x200B;

* **Current Goals**:

I still love training calisthenics, my main life goal is to achieve F skills on rings eventually. Currently I'm focusing at the moment on getting Iron Cross, cleaning up my Maltese, Maltese Cross, and cleaning up my Victorian Cross

**Diet and Nutrition**:

* **General Info**:

I don't have much to say on my diet so this section is going to be brief. I'm in a lucky position where I've always been relatively skinny so I've never had to focus to much time on losing weight.

When I was in college, I was in a University that was ranked for having one of the best dinning services in the US. I always had access to healthy foods back then so my diet was varied and relatively clean with the occasional eating out. It was balanced as in I ate my fruits, veggies, grains, meats in most my meals. I couldn't tell you exactly what I ate because it was mostly intuitive. I don't count calories or anything.

Since college I've been living with my folks (moving out around April so that's exciting) and they cook every day. It's traditional Bengali dishes, so again food is generally clean and varied. I do however not eat as much veggies and fruits as I used back in college and need to fix that from a nutrition stand point. But over all I have an easy time maintaining a consistent weight. I also rarely drink alcohol.

* **Bulking and Cutting**: So I don't bulk or cut. I like slowly gaining weight over time. That's just me.
* **Supplementation**: I take creatine and protein powder that's it. I think most people do not ""need"" supplements, a good rule of thumb is to use supplements to enhance lagging parts of your diet. Actually requiring supplements is probably a conversation between you and your doctor.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\_7z6VscypA&t=1298s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_7z6VscypA&t=1298s)

This post is already pretty long now so I'll keep this section a bit short.

* Fitness has had a huge positive impact on my life! I'm so glad I started lifting weights in middle school :D. I hope everyone else also has an great fitness journey.
* Switching to calisthenics took my fitness journey to the next leve. I'm the strongest I've ever been because of it. This isn't because calisthenics is any better than other forms of training. I just have some much more fun training it which has helped me stay consistent and discplined.
* I've also met awesome people through it's really been a net positive in my life
* Be honest with yourself when you train, bad form can really waist your time or get you hurt.
* Hopefully this post was somewhat informative and peaks others interest into the wonderful world of bodyweight training (it's more than just calisthenics)

&#x200B;

All the best,

"Discussion: Has anyone tried palm or extremity cooling to increase work volume (from Huberman Lab podcast, episode 19)?",25,phryax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/phryax/discussion_has_anyone_tried_palm_or_extremity/,23,1630763612.0,"I've been listening to the Huberman Lab podcast and in episode 19, he describes a study where cooling your palms in-between sets radically increased the number of reps a person can do (300% for dips!). 

The idea is that hyperthermia limits performance and cooling through the extremities prevents that.

Huberman claims that this methodology is being used by lots of sports teams and that they've been getting great results.

Frankly, this sounds way too good to be true. 

[There are a number of peer reviewed papers demonstrating the effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22076097/), however:

* They're from the original authors, who started a company to commercialize the technology
* The company was founded in 2000 and don't appear to have been able to bring anything to market in the last 20 years.
* I found a couple examples of replications that don't show anything like the effect size the original authors see, plus the results don't show a proper dose/response.

I'm tempted to try this myself to see if there's any validity to the claims (easy enough experiment and claimed gains are enormous). 

***Has anyone tried palm or extremity cooling themselves or know of any independent publications that either prove or debunk it?***",2021-09-04 16:53:32

---

**Background Info**

I started lifting with my dad as a young kid. I am in my mid-thirties now. There were some extended breaks from training over the years, but I always maintained an active physical lifestyle playing sports, working construction, etc. 

You can find more detailed background information in my previous program writeups.

* [Simple Jack’d 2x](https://removeddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/lrg0tt/program_review_simple_jackd_2x_3_months_of_high/)

* [Smarathlov](https://removeddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/hd9ao1/smarathlov_13_weeks_of_the_full_smolov_program/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

*(Links are to removeddit, give them time to load)*

So fast forward a bit, and we get to spring 2021. I just wrapped up *”Simple Jack’d”*, and decided to sign up for a meet. Now I had to decide how to train for it.

---

**Enter – DLED – Deadlift Every Day**

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.
I decided to start this program with a new approach, similar to *""Simple Jack’d""*, but with some rules.

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.   
2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.  
3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.  

If the week goes well and all the reps are completed, add 1 rep, or 1% to the daily minimum, and move onto week 2. Maintain the weekly 1 rep minimum at the same intensity unless I  set a new 1RM PR.

[**In the end, this is how my 50 days of programming looked.**](https://imgur.com/a/3rqWd7v)

* Week 1: 3 reps at 605 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 2: 3 reps at 610 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 3: 4 reps at 610 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 4: 4 reps at 615 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 5: 5 reps at 615 Every Day, 1 at 690+ Every Week
* Week 6: 5 reps at 635 Every Day, 1 at 690+ Every Week
* Week 7: 1 rep at 675 Every Day, 1RM Conventional and Sumo
* Day 50: 700 AMRAP

**DLED Accessories/Assistance**

I decided to pair my high frequency low volume deadlifting, with the polar opposite for accessory work. A basic, single muscle group per day, “Bro Split”. I would hit that single muscle group with high volume of a single lift, and then move on.

**Cardio**
I [ran 171 miles](https://imgur.com/a/ZNkO9Po) over the course of these 50 days. An average of 3.4 miles per day. My longest run was 8 miles.

I strongly believe that a good base of cardiovascular fitness enables me to work harder, longer, and in the end, lift more weight.

**Training Log/Highlights**

My full deadlift training log for these 50 days can be found [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K5QE-2xhDuRMh3LIGg5N7aONbVOcy-VV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true) with videos of the top set each day hyperlinked in the log.

Here are some highlights of my favorite sets

* Day 50: [702x8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sJztQowXHAr0G3hi-cGUUHlFwRxytpk0/view?usp=drivesdk) TnG Sumo AMRAP

**Data / Summary**

Overall I hit 187 reps over 600lb in 50 days, for a total volume of 120,252 lb. That's makes the average day 3-4 reps at 640+

The lowest daily weight I hit was 605, the highest was 752 off the floor, and 815 off of wagon wheels with the top set estimating out to 889 on day 50 ([702x8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sJztQowXHAr0G3hi-cGUUHlFwRxytpk0/view?usp=drivesdk))

Of those reps, 134 were hook grip, and 53 were strapped, 32 were conventional, and 155 were sumo.

---

**Using Variation to combat Fatigue**

If you look through the training log, or have followed any of my comments in the weightroom daily discussion threads, you’ll notice that I used a LOT of variation throughout the last 50 days.

These variations weren’t chosen entirely haphazardly. In fact, I put a lot of thought into what I was going to do each day/week ahead of time, and then paid close attention to how I felt to adjust along the way.

Here are a couple examples of how lift selection could facilitate recovery or increase stimulus without just adding/decreasing weight:

* When my [thumbs were hurting](https://imgur.com/a/YJl0kQj) I would use straps
* If my hips felt good I would pull sumo
* If my lower back was feeling good, I would pull conventional
* If my lower back and hips were both feeling good I would go heavier, and hit more than my daily minimum intensity
* If my upper back felt strong and rested, but I didn’t want to overwork my lower back or hips, I would add bands or chains, increasing the intensity at the top of the lift, without increasing demands at the bottom
* When my positioning felt sloppy, I would add paused reps.

Every variation had a purpose, and was chosen to fit that day based on how I felt when I woke up, and in the hours leading up to my training.

---

**Diet, Sleep, Recovery**

My starting weight was 228 and my ending weight was 225, a net loss of 3lb

I tracked calories for a bit at the beginning of this 50 day period, but stopped about halfway through. At the time I was eating around 4,200 calories per day and maintaining. 

As for *what* I eat... it varies, but I'm a big fan of carbs. I aim for 180g+ of protein,  100g+ of fat, and then fill in the remaining with 600+g of carbs

I usually start the day with some sort of PB&J, my favorite is to [Toast a Blueberry Bagel, add Chunky Peanut Butter, Honey, Raspberry Jelly, Fruity Pebbles]() and maybe a banana. 

Mid day I usually eat out, because I work pretty far from home. My go-tos are burritos, sandwiches, pizza, all the good stuff people tell you to avoid if you are a serious lifter... I eat it.

Dinner is usually whatever my wife makes, it changes all the time due to kids, and I don't worry too much about it.

If I am hungry, I eat more.

If I'm tired, I eat more.

If I'm sore, I eat more.

If I am feeling achy or run down? I'll eat a bunch of gummy worms and drink a half gallon of OJ, then go for a run.

I don't take / never have taken steroids. Due to a pituitary tumor I have [multiple recent blood tests](https://imgur.com/a/o1xQk6F) showing my T levels, and offer my physique as further evidence.



I try to go to sleep before 10:00pm every night, and usually wake up around 5:00am

I do LISS cardio as often as possible, preferably in more frequent, shorter doses

*(I find that two 5ks are easier to recover from than a single 10k)*

---

**CNS fatigue and overtraining**

You see it all the time on internet forums. 
“You cant do X, you’ll overtrain”, or “Deadlifts are too taxing on the CNS to do more than a single set of 5 per week”

Obviously that’s ridiculous. 

Now, I am not going to say overtraining isn’t real, or that it doesn’t happen. It does. But it is just REALLY hard to get to that point if you are paying attention to the other variables. 

If deadlifting 600-750 for reps every day for weeks on end, while also running [171 miles](https://imgur.com/a/ZNkO9Po) doesn’t result in overtraining, you are probably going to be OK adding that 3rd set of curls to the end of your 5x5 LP

The key is to focus on what I mentioned above in diet/sleep/recovery. 

Eat, sleep, do your conditioning. 

**Pain and Injury**

I’ve dealt with many injuries over the years, from broken bones and torn muscles, to herniated discs, jambs, sprains, and dislocations…. and I had a few little bangs and tweaks over the last 50 days as well.

Going into this, I hadn’t pulled with a hook grip on a regular basis. Within the first week [I had bruising on both thumbs, a split in my thumb nail, and a tear on two fingers](https://imgur.com/a/YJl0kQj). It took some adjustment, but I learned how to fix my grip, and was able to train through the discomfort, to the point that I am now comfortable holding 750+lb without issue, and my thumbs are all healed up.

I also [smashed my toes](https://imgur.com/a/DesKPOx) one day, they bled a bit and bruised badly. I thought that my middle toe may have been broken, but a bit of tape holding it to the other toes, and some caution while running was enough to let me push through it. Although it is still hurting to this day.

Then, on day 46 I tweaked something in my lower back [pulling 700 beltless](https://imgur.com/a/Zg3NPrP). I actually felt a bit of a pop and immediately dropped to the ground. Everyone has heard of R.I.C.E. (rest, ice, compression, elevation) but I refused to let a back injury sidetrack me again. 

I **immediately** started working at it. Instead of RICE I opted for **MEAT/METH**, Motion, Elevation, Analgesics, Treatment/Traction, and Heat. What this means, is that I didn’t just lay down. I started foam rolling, stretching, taking Ibuprofin, working the area with a lacrosse ball, heat packs, hot baths, hot showers, walking, and even some light jogging, etc.

On day 47 I woke up in the morning STIFF and SORE. I immediately attacked the issue again with the same ***Meth***ods. Later on I was able to [Deadlift 675 off wagon wheels](https://imgur.com/a/8f2RP2C), which reduced the ROM to the point of less discomfort, and got out for a nice run without too much pain.

On day 48 I was already feeling significantly better, but I was still stiff and sore. Once again, I employed the same methods and rehabbed my way through the pain until I could touch my toes with straight knees, and pick up my kids without holding my breath. Later that day I would [pull 765 pounds off of wagon wheels](https://imgur.com/a/cidrMI7) again. This time with even less discomfort than the day before.

On day 49 I woke up feeling like I was back to 80+%. But I took the time, and the medicine, and worked through the same drills and stretches. Later that day I would [pull 675 off the floor](https://imgur.com/a/mlN6iqK) for my first full ROM deadlift since the injury, and then go on to [pull 765, and 815](https://imgur.com/a/mlN6iqK) off the wagon wheels, ending with a nice big PR.

On day 50, I felt great, and finished with a big [702x8](https://imgur.com/a/F6ltIXw) deadlift AMRAP for a new all time PR on my estimated max… and did so completely pain free. 

I am still a bit tight and sore in the morning, but its improving every day, and I am diligent about working at it. Staying moving, working the area, taking basic meds like Ibuprofen, foam rolling, stretching, and even lifting all make a huge difference on healing faster.

**Conclusion**

This couldn’t have gone better. At the outset I had no idea I was about to put 40lb on my deadlift 1RM in only 50 days. 

[**Starting 1RM: 712 vs  Ending 1RM: 752**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lLbVGr8sXoPsYXhab3yQHSLJtWB6WRJD/view?usp=sharing)

And better yet, I learned a lot about myself, about training, about diet, and recovery, about pain and fatigue management, and more.

Is your deadlift stalling? Should you go deadlift 600+ Every day now? 

Probably not. 

But if you look at your training, I'm sure there is room to do **MORE...**

Comment,1,j0o2fv3,,0,1671333510.0,"I think it might be a form thing. I've never heard of a shoulder issue for barbell squats. make sure your core is tight and chest is puffed out. push from the heels, try to imagine using your glutes to do the work. You shouldn't really be feeling any arm or shoulder pressure.

you might want to try pin squats instead of the traditional bb squats.

could also be that your shoes are not great for squats or your calves are too tight.",2022-12-18 05:18:30

currently bulking again, 8 weeks in, strength blasting off again, but idk if it's worth the fat gains, like i'm probably at most am gaining .5 pounds of muscle every 4 weeks.

i'm not gaining that much fat, I still look jacked without a shirt. it's just when i'm bulking the fat goes to my face first and facial aesthetics are out the window.",2022-12-18 05:12:59

Comment,1,j0o0o9c,,0,1671332609.0,"It isn't just the stance width. This lift is pretty different from a conventional front squat. You are bending back and away from the bar, so that your hips end up way behind the bar. With a barbell this wouldn't be possible because you have to keep balanced.

You also keep your elbows really low and round your back a lot.

Had a monster workout. Then I drank my creatine and whey.

I just started taking testosterone supplements and diindolylmethane earlier in the week, and I had so much extra energy and drive and I worked out again.

Pushups until the point of failure this time but high tempo and high reps.

Then I have to walk and bend very carefully, setting it off is a very extreme pain. 

Bulged disc, herniated disc, what is it? and how can I heal it for good, a physical therapist? I got a massage recently and when the masseuse goes over it the area is actually bruised and hurts now compared to any other area of spine that only feels alleviated afterwards, even now it is hurt like a bruise or sprained injury.

Comment,1,j0nxbms,,0,1671330940.0,"I caught my front edge on a rail and flew through the air, landing on my knee. Tried to stand back up but couldn’t.

Driving home was fun because we drove my manual transmission car to the mountain and neither my brother nor my buddy knew how to drive it well so I gave instructions from the back seat while my clutch was brutalized.

Over the next day or so it swelled up to about the size of a large grape fruit. Dr put me in an immobilizer with crutches for 3-4 months and then walking was awkward for a while after that.

Comment,1,j0nvux0,,0,1671330217.0,"What exactly is your concern? This is a little difficult to critique because it is not a very common lift (imho). 

It looks like you are probably working your quads well without too much concern for injury. That being said, your upper back is quite rounded over, which I personally would work to keep neutral and tight, esp if you want this to have carryover to a traditional front squat. Also your stance is as narrow as can be. It doesn’t seem to imped you though so I guess that’s ok. It kind of somehow turns this into a smith-machine-double-front-squat-lunge in a way.",2022-12-18 04:23:37

Comment,1,j0ns3ix,,0,1671328422.0,"For your first question, you did not lose out on your noob gains. When I comes to gains, think of it like this. For every pound of muscle you gain over baseline m, the next pound gets a little harder. So you really can’t miss out on noob gains.   


With your second question, as a beginner it’s normal to progress week to week, but is not guaranteed. Also when people they talk about week to week progression, they are normally referring to big compound movements, like squat or bench press, not isolation movements like curls.",2022-12-18 03:53:42

Comment,1,j0nqckh,,0,1671327580.0,"I am worried about my starting fitness journey.

So to add some context, I am fairly new to fitness (throughout 2 years I've been around 8-10 times) and this is my first reason for worry, did I lose my chance to have noob gains? Because I already went multiple times but with too much time in  between, so the muscle I gained then is already lost.(sorry if this is a stumid question)

My second reason for worry is because right now I'm not seeing any improvement, I went 3 times but my curls haven't improved at all (weight or rep). I come across a lot of people saying that during ""noob gains"" you improve at every workout. 

I should also mention that I am coming back from a wrist injury. Before my injury I went to the gym and could curl a certain amount of weight and my left (non-injured) arm gave out first. After my injury (almost healed still some slight pain) my right gives out before my left at an even lower weight than when my left used to give out. Is this something I should be worried about?

Again sorry for any stupid questions or questions that have already been asked, also sorry for a probably incoherent rant  I'm just really worried. Thanks to anyone who helps/answers",2022-12-18 03:39:40

So after you do your exercise, you record the distance traveled, time spent doing it, and level of exhaustion(think 1 to 10). Put it in in excel/Google sheets with a Date. 

You can decide you want to improve your pace by sticking with the same amount of time but going a greater distance. You could also decide you want to keep to a set pace but for greater time. Pro move would be to work on both to keep things interesting and to improve overall performance.

Is a healthy diet (ditch fast food, unhealthy snacks) and continuing my climbing 4x week training enough to do that? Should I increase my workout or replace a climbing session with cardio etc.?

Comment,7,j0msql6,,0,1671312256.0,"Hey! Yep I’m a woman and I’m a couple weeks into Super Squats. It’s going well so far. 

You might want to go up by a smaller increment not because you’re female but because your max is pretty low. 2.5 lbs on a 100 lb squat is the same percentage as 5 lbs on a 200lb squat. You might also want to consider starting at what is an easy set of 10, rather than a 10RM. That’s one of the original bits of advice that sometimes gets lost. 

Don’t worry about testosterone. Estrogen actually does some of the same muscle building/recovery functions in our bodies that testosterone does for dudes. Whatever the reason, training principles are pretty much the same. You can follow any program guys do without any special gender related adjustments. 

That said, super squats sounds ridiculous and impossible because *that’s just how it is*. The progression seems to work really well for new lifters and those returning from a break. It’s not necessarily sustainable and you shouldn’t expect it to be. Just hop on the struggle bus and hang on for dear life. It’s only 6 weeks (as commonly practiced), and as they say, anything works for 6 weeks. If you can’t complete a set, just eat like a horse and try again in 2 days.",2022-12-17 23:24:16

Comment,5,j0mmvlp,,0,1671309809.0,"My gym has been adding/replacing some equipment out of the blue. Which is a nice surprise. The first thing that happened was one day I come in and they replaced the leg press with a new model and have all new dumbbells. Both are nice improvements, with the one small exception of the new dumbbells having extra girthy handles. When I first used them for single-arm pulls my grip started going out before failure of the pull muscles. So, as today is a pull day, I will be sure to wear my straps. Then the next thing that happened was a NEW hack squat unit suddenly appeared! Its pretty nice. Leg day is always a bit of a fuckaround after squats. So it'll be nice to have something else to treat like a real exercise. I go through the motions with the seated quad machine, and the hamstring machine, and there's always the calf raise on the smith machine or the seated calf raise. And the leg press. But I just really don't much get into any of those things for some reason. Working out legs is just no fun. So anyway, this hack squat seems promising for my uninspired leg day workout.",2022-12-17 22:43:29

Comment,2,j0mlk6w,,0,1671309244.0,"If you start working out you might need to add in slightly more calories so that you don’t lose weight too quickly, but that’s about the only change you would need to make. 

As for the workout - you should go with a mix of cardio and weights. Start easy on both.  E.g. start the cardio with a slow 20min walk each day and then bump up the time and speed as you get fitter. For the weights just start with the basic beginner routine or bodyweight routine from [the fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).

As a side note - 5 years ago I was fat, sedentary, and out of shape. I’ve since dropped ~50lbs and added in a bunch of cardio and weight training to my weeks and I feel amazing. When you’re fit it’s like living life on easy mode. I used to dread stairs, now I’ll take them because it’s quicker than waiting for an elevator.",2022-12-17 22:34:04

Comment,9,j0m9um0,,0,1671304297.0,"Been hitting the gym after a long time since a month. I bench 40kg 4x10 reps and have been wanting to move to 60kg for the longest time now. I switched gyms last month and failed a 60kg rep miserably at my last gym. And I feel like the fear of failing again has stuck with me. The other day at my current gym, I unloaded the 10kg plates, loaded the 20kg ones, laid down, went for the lift off and as soon as I felt they wouldn’t bulge, I gave up and unloaded. Then I just benched using the 10kg plates instead. I know this is in my head but I felt like everyone must have been thinking what is this mf doing loading weights and doing 0 reps with them haha

Yesterday I had an Eureka moment and figured why not just use the 15kg plates on each side and see how I fare with them. Gladly I completed two sets, first one 8 reps and the second one 5. Next time I try 20kg plates I’ll probably ask someone to spot me. I’m sure I can get a few reps in, I just need to be mote confident that I can do it.",2022-12-17 21:11:37

Comment,0,j0m4ct3,,0,1671302051.0,"That’s pretty active. 

The calculator works like this: 

- level one, you are bed bound. But your body still functions and expends energy, your BASE rate therefore is 2000 per day (random example) 
- level two, you walk a little every day and don’t do any real activities but still obviously burn more than level one, say 200 calories more, then your rate is 2200 per day. 
- level three you walk a little every day BUT ALSO go to the gym for a run 3 times a week. And burn 500 cals every run, that’s 1500 per week and average of 215 per day. So your rate is 2000+200+215 = 2415. 

And so on.",2022-12-17 20:34:11
Comment,1,j0m4bym,,0,1671302041.0,"Personally, I only focus on my numbers for compound lifts in the low rep range. So for instance my chest day, I usually hit a 5/3/1 rep range on my bench press and each week I add 2.5-5LBS. After that, I do my hypertrophy training and I’m 100% focused on mind/muscle connection and not so much the weight. If I surpass 12 reps on my first set I’ll bump up the weight, but building muscle is all about tearing down tissue and eating to rebuild. So full range of motion, slow negatives, holding the stretch and squeeze. Little unorthodox but it works great for me",2022-12-17 20:34:01

And you also don't have to do them ""Tabearta"" style, that's one of mythical's wonderfully cruel inventions. You could scale it by doing one complex every 30s, 3 every minute, go for the tabearta with less weight.

Looking for a gym program. Ideally 3-4 days a week.  
  
About Me : M23, 185 cm, around 220 lb, Grad Student. Sedentary lifestyle.  
  
Goals : Lose weight to about 200 lb. And then maybe focus on aesthetics.  
  
Last week I started cycling and I've been hitting 10 miles in an hour for last couple of days. I've already started a calorie deficit for weight loss. I would like to start going to the gym after a couple of weeks of cycling. I feel like cycling will increase my stamina to help accomodate a lifting program with my regular activities.   
  
I plan to keep this going on. I'll cycle 10-12 miles on off days. And I'll cycle of 5-7 miles on gym days and then hit the gym. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. Any tips/suggestion on this?  
  
I've been looking at some beginner friendly lifting programs and I think I find ""Thinner Leaner Stronger"" to be the best fit for me. But it is kind of daunting to me that the program has bench presses and dead lifts from the first week itself. Is it something I should start with considering I don't have any experience in lifting? Will it be overwhelming? Should I try to use any machines instead of dumbbells and barbell(like if there is any exercise I can do on a machine that is an alternatives of this?) or is it the same? Also, the gym in my campus doesn't have a trainer. I will mostly be taking help from a few of my fitness enthusiast friends for things like posture, balance, etc.  
  
Are there any other lifting programs that might be helpful to me? How is GreySkull LP?",2022-12-17 20:29:54

Remember, you're arching in part to reduce ROM, and you can't reduce ROM without getting your chest up high.

Neither is much of a concern unless you're moving significant weight and/or ignoring pain.  Even then the majority of injuries are short term recoveries that teach important lessons.

As a beginner the whole point is to learn how to properly move things and activate your body.  The only way to learn is to practice. Practice means going to the gym.

Follow your routine and *practice*.  Warmup sets are practice.  If you have an icky squat set, drop the weight and practice.  Use 'paused' variants with light weights to practice.  Do light singles to practice your setup, walkout, and lift.  Watch form/cue videos as you practice for months and months to get a better perspective.

Comment,1,j0lxdd0,,0,1671299159.0,"Kind of in a predicament here

I’m running greg nuckols bench/squat 3 days per week and deadlift 1 day per week beginner programs

My one rep maxes for b/s/dl are 225/275/315

I’m 6’4 235 and I’d say I’m overweight in the mirror but my squat progress is grinding to a halt recently. A guy at my gym says I should try to get more rest and give it three more weeks before switching things up.

What should I do if I can’t progress my squat in the next few weeks?",2022-12-17 19:45:59

Comment,3,j0lqy03,,0,1671296461.0,"I want my glute’s bigger so I decided to start bulking. I had been cutting for 6 months and was almost at my weight goal. I decided it wasn’t mentally healthy to continue cutting. I’ve been bulking since November 1st. My glutes have gotten bigger but so has my gut. I just want them to be huge while having abs. I also started taking creatinine. I have been lifting for yrs so I’m not a beginner in that department. I just need a little guidance. I know it’s not smart to be lean throughout the year. At the same token I haven’t been able to get under 20% body fat. So should I go back to cutting, and get under 20% body fat? Then possibly bulk? Is it counterproductive to start a bulk when I haven’t hit my body fat % goal? I did make a lot of progress this year.",2022-12-17 19:01:01

And machines were BAD, because they weren't free weights and didn't use your stabilizing muscles, so you would be small forever.

And at least personally, I did get distracted by those big numbers the people in here claimed to have. I felt like I had ""terrible genetics"" or something because my bench 1 RM after 1 year of training was just 100 kg, while so many others were claiming to do that for reps after a few months of training.

Comment,1,j0lnqus,,0,1671295125.0,"Hey all,
I have a question regarding calorie intake. I am 23 years old, weigh 72 kg and go to the gym 5-6 times a week. I was kinda fat a year ago, weighing in at 90 kg. Over the past year I lost a lot of weight by eating 1500 cal daily. 3 months ago I started to see my abs, but due to an internship I didn’t go to the gym for 3 months and they disappeared again. Im confident I can get them back in like a month if I keep cutting but I feel if I wanna get actual muscles I def. Should eat in a surplus’s and somewhat ignore the Abs for know. When I put my numbers in a calorie calculator I get suggested that I should eat 3000 calories per day. This number seems very high to me, and I fear that I will just get fat following that diet. My goal is it to increase in mass but stay somewhat lean. Besides going to the gym I would say that I’m not active, I work a desk job 2 days a week, and study in the library or watch YouTube in my „free time“.

Do you guys think 3000 calories a day is a reasonable amount of calories for me to consume?",2022-12-17 18:38:45

Wasn't very optimistic since I slept badly the night before. The first rep was hard, but on the second the weight felt _good_. Pushed out another two reps, totalling 7.

I used to think that if I keep lifting the same weights with 3 reps of 15, I'd gain strength eventually and be able to lift heavier. With that said, I checked my BMI and it says I'm at a BMI of 23.2 so I wouldn't say I'm overweight.

I'm on a slight deficit diet currently like you suggested. Only challenge is hitting the protein goals. Whey is very expensive and I can't afford it and I'm a vegetarian so at most I get 50g protein per day. Veg diet is extremely carb heavy and protein deficient even when it's super clean.

Just as a rule of thumb never take anything influencers say as a fact, especially when they're talking about anecdotes for what worked for them/a trainee. They could be a genetic outlier, it could be a result of years of work and not just a thing you can start doing today, or they could just be straight up lying about their activity level, caloric intake, etc. When something doesn't make sense but seems to work for one person, trust what makes sense, not one person trying to sell you stuff.",2022-12-17 17:47:23

Comment,1,j0lfy3f,,0,1671291715.0,"The beginner routine is three sets of five.  If a mere five reps of squats taxes you, it's a conditioning thing.    


A:  Swap out bb squat for goblet squat for a few sessions and aim for 5x12 @ 25 lbs.  Five sets of twelve with a mere 25 lb dumbbell.  Focus on setting your shoulders/scapula back-and-down, and squatting between your legs so you can get proper depth.  Rest 2-5 minutes.  


2:  Swap out deadlift for RDL for a few sessions, aim for 3x12.  Focus on setting your shoulders/scapula back-and-down, keeping the bar close to your body, and feeling a stretch in the hamstrings at the bottom.  


D:  20 -40 minutes of treadmill intervals.  Use the timer on the treadmill and break it into five minute blocks.  Your speed will vary, but I know my comfortable walking pace is 3.3 mph.  I can hold that pace without ever being out of breath.  Bump to a slow jogging pace of 4 mph for ten seconds.  Just second seconds.  Jog.  Then drop down to 3.3 mph for 4 minutes and 50 seconds.  Repeat 3-7 times.  Next session, jog 15 seconds on, 4:45 off.  Next session, 20 seconds on, 4:40 off.  etc",2022-12-17 17:41:55

I've been feeling very low on energy/lethargic lately(maybe it's the winter) but anyway I want to try a healthier approach to my diet, mostly removing (ultra)processed foods, sugary foods, packaged foods, just a healthier/natural approach.

I know the carnivoreMD dude is very controversial, but I've followed him for a while and milk,meat,eggs,fruits,honey are all foods I really enjoy anyway(maybe except organs).

I've always been an under-eater/ecto/hardgainer guy, I know it's the basic caloric surplus that needs to be reached, but I wonder if people found it harder/easier to gain mass on a diet similar to this? Also Paul (from carnivorMD) apparently eats 3500-3700kcal without gaining weight and I believe he is only like 165lbs, he claims to have a higher bmr because of his quality diet and possibly healthy thyroid, he also surfs and is active, but not that extreme.

Comment,-1,j0l2jwa,,0,1671285003.0,"I have been bulking for a month so far. This is not my first time and I usually bulk around autumn/winter every year for about 4-6 months before spring/summer.

Although been training for roughly 10-11 years to date, my gym has been on/off during the periods between 2014-2015, 2016-2017 and first half of 2020 and first half of 2021 due to reasons beyond my control (university, full-time work and study, injury, then Covid, lockdowns and gyms closed).

It's been now more than a year I have been consistent with decent results. I usually cycle my diet: when I bulk I go very high carb on my training days (500-550g cho) and low on my rest ones, but my energy intake has always been around 3500-4500 in the last 3-4 weeks. And, please don't kill me!, i go keto after winter (i do love fatty food).

After cutting hard for various weeks I gained a 3-4 kg, mostly because of glycogen and stool (I do eat a shit-ton of fiber).

Although all the gaslighting about ""lean bulking"" and small surplus, I decided to up my intake but in the last 3 weeks I have noticed my weight hasn't been going above 84-85 kg. If I go low carb on my rest days, it even goes back to 81-82!

How the heck am I spending 4000 cal a day?

Now, this doesn't bother me too much. I have never been and hard gainer. I can show some pics when I was DEXA assessed and I was around 10.7% BF.

But how come I do spend so much energy throughout the day? Keep on mind my lifestyle would be classified as ""sedentary"" by most TDEE calculators online but there's a lot of nuances in that (I work with a standing desk, my NEAT is very high and I walk about 10-15k steps daily with 20-25k around weeks).

Is fast metabolism the only answer?

The funny thing is: I gain weight as easy as I lose it.",2022-12-17 15:50:03
Comment,2,j0l2jrl,,0,1671285001.0,"Hi all


MythicalStrength did a great write-up on bear complexes, so I want to try them, since I'm doing 531 and my conditioning sucks


Just some quick tips for understanding: 


do you ""stop"" after each exercise, or do you use the momentum? E.g. Use the squat momentum for press


Is it okay to do it slowly and with little weight, to get into it?


Can I also do like 3 sets and then take a longer break? (e.g. A minute). Like I said, my conditioning sucks

Yes I do have an understanding of what to expect from certain foods but its hard to estimate how much fat a homemade meal has when the person who cooked isn't around. Its so hard to eat similar things each day and there is no way I can keep up something like that for months on end. I'll just shed the excess fat in a month by starving and be done with continuous dieting that never works out.

Also building muscle is fun and easy, losing fat not so much. Going to gym everyday and eating like a king is much more fun and doable than dieting.",2022-12-17 15:32:19

Comment,1,j0l0hab,,0,1671283785.0,"I apologize if I'm posting in the wrong place. I've been going to the gym for about 5 months now, mainly with the goal of losing weight. I started at around 135 kg and am now 96.5 kg. I do see a difference, but after losing almost 40 kg, I don't see a huge change. Will losing another 16 kg really make a big difference? I've also been going without a specific plan or routine. I've hired personal trainers, but to be honest, they've mainly just been taking my money without providing much value. I'm a college student and started going to the gym just when I turned 17, so I don't have a lot of money to spend. I recently found a workout plan online, but I'm not sure if it will really help me lose weight and build muscle. Is there a place I could get my plan checked by someone?",2022-12-17 15:29:45

Comment,1,j0kznwo,,0,1671283291.0,"Q: Are there any good shoulder exercises that go easy on the rotator cuffs?

So I'm new here but I would like some input on this. I've been working out for 3 months and it's going very well. Unfortunately, lately I've been starting to feel a bit of pain in the shoulder after my workouts, which would take a couple of days to go away. It's definitely more than just the regular post-workout tenderness.

Pain is mostly when I raise my arm up overhead, and when my arms are crossed/lying on the side in bed. I figured it probably had something to do with my shoulder exercises (but maybe it's not?). First I stopped doing Arnolds and just doing regular overhead dumbbell presses. I think my form is all right and I try to not have my arms too far back. Still, problem persists.

Comment,3,j0kvlpz,,0,1671280615.0,"I was working out consistently for like a year without any kind of focus, nor understanding that eating in a surplus is better than trying to maintain. I had my lifts go up somewhat, but nothing impressive to write home about. 

Then I got a trainer (not required, I got for other reasons besides just wanting to make progress). After about 6 months with him plus eating more, I had made some visual changes. After a year it was a night and day difference (and I'm a woman, so a guy could probably see more changes). 

2 months is nothing. And not having a plan, not eating right and not recovering will slow progress down massively. 

Having a routine doesn't mean you're training like a body builder. A routine is good for everyone",2022-12-17 14:36:55

Comment,1,j0kv5q4,,0,1671280304.0,"Probably overthinking this but would really appreciate some people’s thoughts on this….

I’m chomping at the bit to start my first serious bulking phase. Struggled hugely with body dysmorphia and have had trouble committing to a weight gaining phase. I’m 5’11/160lbs and spent most of the last 2-3 years below maintenance calories (probably 80% of the last 3 years spent cutting). BUT I’m going on vacation in 4 weeks from now, where for 2 weeks I’m undoubtedly going to be consistently over consuming (including more alcohol than I’m used to), as well as my normal training being interrupted. 

Is it sensible to just chill at around maintenance until then, then spend a couple of weeks when I’m back undoing the little bit of inevitable fat gain from an enjoyable vacation, before committing to the long term, slow bulking phase?

In my head it seems sensible to wait until then, and set myself up for the longest possible bulk/best possible headroom to bulk, rather than to look to be increasing my bodyweight now ahead of a couple of weeks away from the normal meticulous discipline that this lifestyle has instilled in me….

All thoughts most appreciated! At present I’m hovering around 160lbs, c. 11-13% BF (one experienced bodybuilder I know eyeballed me at 9-10% but I think I’m higher than that personally, just because I’m not overly muscular, so although I don’t have tons of fat, its probably driving my percentage higher than the same amount of BF would be on a more muscular dude).",2022-12-17 14:31:44

Thinking about running - a totally normal thing you learn to do instinctively as a toddler. Yet so many people asking questions about how to run at r/running. Nothing is as easy as you think it might be.

Anyways, more is not better. Doing all the machines at 3x12 is quantity rather than quality. When I go to the gym I usually do like 6-7 exercises tops, most days I'm lazy and it's like 4. I only focus on the main compound lifts (e.g. bench press, squat) and really dial down on doing a good job on fewer exercises.

To answer your other question, dumbbells force you to use stabilizer muscles and engage your core. If your form is bad, you'll probably notice. Machines are kind of a shortcut in that sense, they take the pressure off.",2022-12-17 14:21:34

 The way I had it explained to me about the whole machined Vs. Free weight is this. 

Machines are great at guiding a body along the moves the machine is made for (like a leg press) and isolates this muscles VERY well. This is great when you just want to hit one muscle, but I found it incredibly confusing knowing what machine does what and how well! A machine is also made for everyone at all levels, meaning that they have a hard time truly fitting just you and your needs.

Free weights are putting extra tension and load on your body's own movement, like a squat, and makes you engage muscles that you need to stabilise that movement (hip abductors, core muscles etc) along with the main muscles worked (glutes, quads, calves). This along with good form makes your body stronger in moving itself and let's your body love along it's own axis and natural range of motion. But form is VERY important and it might be hard to increase the weight as fast as with machines.

Both have theirs spots in fitness, I made the switch to a more free weight based routine after feeling like tha machines were only making me strong in the gym. But I still LOVE including leg press in my workout instead of squats sometimes :)",2022-12-17 14:18:39

Comment,2,j0ktsll,,0,1671279318.0,"Yeah, 2 lbs per month would be really fast progress. So you probably were under that, so let's guess 1.5 lbs per month. So in 2 months maybe you gained 3 lbs of muscle out of the 10 lbs total you gained. I wouldn't expect to see the gain of 3 lbs of muscle in someone who weighed 260 lbs. So even if you were making great progress you wouldn't see it in 2 months.

>How much reading and video watching do I need to do to become competent? Are we talking like 1 or 2 hours per evening for weeks and weeks?

I have got to be honest, it seems like you kind of just want to complain about this. Any hobby or skill takes effort. People who want to make progress read and watch about their hobby because they want to know more. If you don't want to put some effort towards working out, then don't. Find something else to do.

1.how long is too long on caloric deficit?

2.how long should a maintain phase last between cuts (I want to hear the minimum effective,not the average,as I'd like to jump back on diet as soon as it gets optimal again)

For those who will say it depends,here is my stats.

start  weight 96.7 (213) at 27bf
I cut 800kcal a day resulting in 0.75kg (roughly 1.5lbs per week.

been going at it for 5 weeks.
and initial plan was like this;

10 weeks diet
6 weeks maintain
10 weeks diet
6 weeks maintain
10 weeks diet

and in theory that should get me a nice physique (after my 1 year of bulking as an initially fatso guy)

The reason I am asking is that I'd rather do;
10-3-10-3-10

is 10 weeks not enough as a cut phase, dunno,want to hear you takes..

Comment,4,j0ks31z,,0,1671278003.0,Ideally I cut for 3 months and bulk the rest of time.,2022-12-17 13:53:23
Comment,3,j0ks17s,,0,1671277961.0,"Did you not progress at anything? Like usually when people start they can say bench press 40kg x5, next week it's 45kg x5 next week it's 50kg x5 etc. Did you not try/see that?",2022-12-17 13:52:41
Comment,3,j0ks05n,,0,1671277937.0,">Given ideal conditions, how fast should lifts be progressing? 

Between 0-100kg per week. 

>Is this an okay rate of progress or should I change something?

If you're making steady progess and are happy with your program I wouldn't change anything.",2022-12-17 13:52:17

Comment,-8,j0krwk7,,0,1671277857.0,"Okay - I will take a break! Thing, I'm just not sure how to revise my deadlifting routine so that squats do not make it weaker and that my benching doesn't make my OHP weaker.

My diet is very low added sugars, high protein, high fat, low carb. I don't count calories so no idea how much I""m eating. I'm afraid to eat more because I'm 5'3'' (low-average) and 130lbs with some muscle. I feel like if I gain more weight, I'll start to look chunky and that's not a look I'm going for. If anything, I want to look more leaner in the legs and core.",2022-12-17 13:50:57
Comment,57,j0krsnz,,0,1671277767.0,Got a new bench PR. 80kg/176 lbs x 6. Really happy,2022-12-17 13:49:27
Comment,11,j0krsi7,,0,1671277764.0,You get quite good at deadlifts,2022-12-17 13:49:24
Comment,12,j0krr0y,,0,1671277729.0,"Haha yeah that's why protein powder in a drink is such a big help :)

Also I really recommend to track your macros for a week or two. For most people it's a good reality check on what you're actually consuming",2022-12-17 13:48:49
Comment,17,j0krq1g,,0,1671277707.0,"Your body will usually tell you if you need a drink. Most people get thirsty during a workout so they have some water with them. Also having a drink after a heavy set helps lower blood pressure and heart rate as it's a human instinct to ""calm down"" when you drink. 

You don't have to though. If you feel fine then not having water during your workout isn't negatively affecting your gains. 

I myself cannot imagine not having water during the workout. But some people make do.",2022-12-17 13:48:27
Comment,2,j0krms6,,0,1671277633.0,"Don't get me wrong, you can do whatever you want, especially in the beginning. But the thing about doing all the strength training on your own when you're starting out, is that you'll have to figure all the important details out along the way. It's easier to just do a beginner's programme. You don't have to worry about anything other than your diet and cardio, it's already accounted for. I'm gonna link the starting strength programme here, then if you wanna look into it you can. And yeah it's rough learning the ropes early on. But best of luck to ya!

Also you might need to check your diet.  You might need to start eating more",2022-12-17 13:45:35
